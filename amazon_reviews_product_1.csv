Jacob,"Not sure how or why these have such great reviews.The only positive thing I have to say is that I appreciate how quiet these can get (almost whisper quiet), which is quite nice. Unfortunately, if you are listening to something with a very quiet recording, you can only barely get these loud enough to hear, and then only if you are in a quiet setting and have both earbuds in place. Because of this type of situation, I was able to learn these earbuds can produce a bass tone I did not otherwise notice with normal listening settings, which was neat, but otherwise useless.Unfortunately, these only come with three size earpieces. You would think they would be enough, but they are not. The medium are too big and hard. If I use them for too long my ear begins to hurt. The small are too small and if I use them, the earbuds do not stay in my ear and are constantly falling out. All the earpieces are also short, so none of them really stay in well. I had to use ear pieces from a less expensive brand that came with 6 different sizes (buds that were only 1/5th the price, too).Because of the twisting motion that is required to put these in your ear properly, I almost always accidentally press the play button before I am ready. Also, even with the more comfortable earpieces I use from another brand, because of the weird footprint these earbuds have, they still do not stay in place well. Also, when repositioning to make sure they don't fall out, I almost always pause what I am listening to by accident. VERY FRUSTRATING.Only while using the better earpieces from the significantly less expensive brand will these buds stay in place while running, but it sounds like someone is playing a bass drum inside my ear everytime my foot hits the ground (PAINFULLY UNCOMFORTABLE). This does not happen with any of the less expensive brands I have owned.There is no standby mode with these, so as soon as the earbuds are out of the charger the battery drain time starts ticking and you only get 8 hours or less when fully charged regardless of whether you are listening to anything or not and regardless of whether you are using the noise canceling or transparency modes or not.The noise canceling function is really not any better with it on or off. The transparency mode is a neat idea, but when there is no sound and nothing is playing it sounds as if you are standing in a wind tunnel (noisy and uncomfortable to listen to). Not worth the loss of battery life to use either function.There is a Beats app you can install. Other than being able to see what mode your earbuds are in, there is really no benefit to installing it though. I had to uninstall it because it was malfunctioning and causing my earbuds to randomly and repeatedly switch into transparency mode (SUPER ANNOYING).The only way to see how much charge is left on the docking station is to check your phone while the lid is open. I don't like that I have to look at my phone to see how much charge the docking station has left instead of having a built in meter like many other brands.There is no effective way to tell if your buds are seated correctly in the docking station and are actually charging.Major buyer's regret after purchasing these. Definitely NOT WORTH THE MONEY.",1.0 out of 5 stars
DOESNT WORK,"I really wanted to love these.However, SO MANY things were wrong with them.-First, they were insanely uncomfortable. No matter what nib size I used, they all had to be pushed in nonstop. Which, of course, then would constantly turn off and on the noise cancelling. Just got annoying.-Second, every time I connected them to my PC, it would essentially freeze the computer. I thought that maybe it was my computer, so I even went through and updated all of the bluetooth drivers. Nothing fixed it. NO OTHER HEADPHONES I have EVER had have done this before.-Third, they would randomly pause and skip songs. Halfway through one, then bam, a song is played a few songs down in my library. Ridiculous! Again, I did consider that it was my phone. But no. Fully updated, and this has never ever happened before using these headphones.-Fourth, the mic quality isn't necessarily bad, just weird. It would pick up on the most random sounds, even moreso than my actual voice. No idea why. Nothing fixed this either.-Fifth, the bass was TERRIBLE. I got these to replace my 1st gen airpods from many years ago, but to make music sound even bearable I had to go in to EQ on settings and make it bass boosted. For 150$ that is NOT something I should have to do.-Sixth, I went to use them at the gym, and while they did stay in my ears, it was only by a thread. I had to constantly push them in no matter what size I used, especially after sweating. Not to mention any exercises laying down. They would just fall right out.So, not only were these headphones some of the most uncomfortable headphones I have ever worn, but they felt flimsy and cheap, the bass was terrible, and they broke basically everything I connected it to. I would absolutely NOT recommend these. Literally buy any other headphones. It was ridiculous how much I tried looking past because they are ""beats."" Terrible. Genuinely. I tried them for 10 days straight and they only disappointed.But hey, the battery lasted a while.Absolutely returning these. Don't waste your time!",1.0 out of 5 stars
Hannah,"Okay So i bought these 3 months ago and they were great for the first two weeks. I bought these as a gift to myself and i thought i was getting a good brand. I was in denial about how bad they were until i had to go back to using a cheap Walmart pair i bought before these. The Walmart pair was so much better then these and i think i spent 20$ on them. These beats earbuds never stay in my ears, the one job they have is to be earbuds and they won’t stay in. I’ve tried all different size rubber pieces and they wont stay. I had to buy the curled earbud pieces, they curl around/into your ear to hold them in there. But because those are the only ones that work you have to put them in a secondary case and carry them with the headphones because you can’t put the earbuds back into there case with those type of rubber pieces on them. Then when i reached out the customer service they told me it was the actual case causing the problems. So i bought a new case. Didn’t fix anything, and just wasted my money. The battery doesn’t last more then 2 hours. Even if your music shuts off or something and you just keep the headphones in until you get a chance to take them out. They will still die, within 2 hrs, even with nothing playing and the noise cancelling feature off. Honestly don’t even think about using the noise canceling feature, your headphones will die in 30-40 min guaranteed. So not only do you buy the headphones but be prepared to buy rubber pieces to actually keep them in your ear and be sure your available to put them back in the charging case every 1.5-2 hours no matter what. Huge waste of money. Spend your money how ever you like but I’m just letting you know that these really do suck.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Luna Selene,"For being Beats and the price that they are, almost everything about them is horrible. Unfortunately, they sound thin and airy. Usually Beats have pretty decent bass but these lack them almost completely. Even using bass boosted audio and an equalizer, the bass only just comes through. They come with an extremely short power cable that can really only be hooked up to a computer and they take a couple hours to charge. They claim that 5 minutes of charge will last for an hour but that couldn’t be further from the truth. If you charge them for 15 minutes, you’ll get 30 minutes of listening at the most. Additionally, the charger charges slow and unevenly, causing the two earbuds to have different charges at any given time; which makes it so one earbud works great but the other sounds even worse or just doesn’t work. Pairing it to my phone is a nightmare. Even though I have the latest updates on my phone, they take a couple minutes to pair, don’t pair at all, or will randomly connect and/or disconnect at random times throughout the day. These also come with three different sizes of earpieces to fit your ear but no matter which size I choose, the shape of the earbud isn’t great and even after following fitting and placement directions, still chafe and dig into the the sides of my ears which hurt after about 10 minutes of use. The only thing going for these headphones is the active noise cancellation, which I will admit, is pretty nice when it works. Unfortunately, about a third of the time I turn active noise cancelling on, they instead play a very shrill and high pitched noise which won’t stop until you turn them off. As I said earlier, for being a name brand like Beats and charging $100 for these earbuds, it’s really disappointing to see such a poorly thought out and executed product like these. Especially considering I can get a pair of off-brand, 20-30sec dollar earbuds that will perform better. In short- don’t waste your money on these. They are not worth it and you will end up wanting to return them. I have nothing against the company, just the product",1.0 out of 5 stars
Ronnie,"Update: While I do stand by everything I wrote below, the item stopped working after a week, so I've updated my review from 5 stars to 1. Also, I didn't realize that Beats is a company owned by Apple, whom I absolutely despise. Good to know later rather than never. I won't be purchasing these or any other Beats products ever again.Wow. Where do I even begin with these.My family was a early adopted of the first Beats products when they were initially released, but at the time, having tried them out, I could not for the life of me stand how much the bass was boosted in them. It was almost like, if you weren't listening to some sort of hip-hop, those things would absolutely obliterate the quality of the music you were listening to. In short, I hated them with an ever-living passion.Fast forward to today. I was desperately in need of some new headphones and decided to give these a shot. Mind you, earbuds were never my thing. They hurt my ears no matter how many different sized eartips you included with the things. Anyways, I bought these, fully expecting not to like them. But oh wow. I don't think I'll ever try another brand of earbuds again. The sound quality is clear as day and the active noise canceling is akin to magic. I've found my match with these and could not be happier.OH! AND THE PACKAGING! I swear, whoever designed the packaging for these things is an absolute genius and an artist! It's minimalistic and practical, yet elegant in a way that somewhat replicates that of Apple's packaging (and I despise Apple and their products, so that should tell you something). Part of me almost likes the packaging more than the actual product! hahaha!In closing, if you don't like earbuds and are more of an over-the-ear headphone kind of person, please, give these a shot. You won't be disappointed.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"I bought these earbuds exactly 11 months ago, since I bought them they have been a complete disappointment, I felt a little pressured to like them just because of the brand and the amount of positive reviews they have, but I gave them 11 months of my life and I'm still giving them more time because of how expensive they were, but without a doubt, a complete waste of money.1. It is noise cancelling, HOWEVER, the mic is actually noise enhancing somehow, so people can never hear me when I'm using them, my husband has a similar pair and being with him on the phone while he's just moving around or doing very minimal activities is headache inducing because of how much they enhance the background noise. I can't even walk by a bag of chips while being on the phone because the person on the other end of the line might pierce their ear drums!2. The app is useless! Does nothing for the background noise situation.3. They aren't consistent, they disconnect and reconnect and disconnect and reconnect, for no reason, doesn't matter what device they are connected to.4. The sound quality is OKAY, just okay, definitely not worth $150. I've had $50 skull candy earbuds that sounded the same.5. The battery life used to be okay, but now 11 months later. Its horrible, I have to charge it multiple times a day, and the battery life it reflects on my phone isn't always accurate, so I definitely thought they gave up on me a few times because it didn't show that the battery was low but they weren't working.6. They are always falling out, its annoying but honestly its not the biggest gripe I have with them!7. They break up, whenever I'm talking to someone or listening to something I just kind of hear it skipping, so if I'm face timing someone I can see their lips moving and sometimes can't hear them, again this is over multiple devices so its not a connection issue or a phone issue its an earbud issue. It does the same thing with videos as well. So it gives me raging migraines if I'm using them for too long.In conclusion: I 've been annoyed by these earbuds for 11 months now, they felt like a bad purchase the second I bought them and I should have just returned them right then and there, but lesson learned! Just because its a big brand and is expensive and 'looks' like its worth the money, doesn't mean it is.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Nicholas Avallone,"I'd love to give these Beats Studio Buds a higher rating. The sound is fantastic: deep bass and clear treble. Noise cancellation is very effective, and they stay in my ears. Battery life is great, and pairing them is a snap.But the connection is ...just bad.They skip once every few minutes. Only for half a second, but it is annoying, and not something any headphones should be doing.I've tried resetting them: no change. I've tried them paired with my iPhone and paired with my iMac: they skip on both.Note, I have a pair of Stiive Bluetooth Headphones that cost 1/5 the price of the Beats, and they never skip on any device. The sound on those isn't as good, but I prefer them to these because they don't skip.**UPDATE - 7 July 2023**Downgrading my review from 2 stars to 1 star.Two weeks ago, I spoke to someone at Apple (who I guess own Beats?), and they assured me that the problem is simply outdated firmware, and suggested I bring them to an Apple Store. But the closest is 1 hour away, so they very graciously offered to send a box and FedEx label for a return and repair. A few days later, I received the box and label, so I promptly sent them off. After a few more days, they returned ...with same issue. And same firmware version!So what did Apple actually do? Who knows? So I got on the phone once again, spoke to another Apple rep, who escalated my case to her manager. The manager assured me he would leave explicit instructions for the technicians to update the firmware this time. So, another wait for a box, and another wait for them to be fixed and shipped back. I received them today once again...and once again, same issue and same firmware version.Now I get to spend another frustrating round with another Apple rep, and another week of shipping nonsense. Will they fix the issue this time? Seems unlikely.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Melissa McVicar,I was so excited to get these thinking finally it's not a 15 to $40 pair with ehh bass n ehhh battery life but overall for the cost of the earbuds they weren't bad. Oh no I got the exact same type of earbuds only this time I paid twice as much money for it boy do I look like an idiot. Absolutely no base whatsoever like I mean none and I'm listening to songs did you can barely hear the lyrics because it's just all Bass. The battery life and the 5 minutes it took me to set them up and get the Squishies right in my ear and open the app I had gone from 100% battery to 90% battery so I can't imagine how long these are going to last to dive started listening to music 10 minutes ago. I will say these will 100% be getting returned to Amazon because they are complete and total waste of money I already have three other pairs of earbuds that totaled cost wise don't reach the cost of this one pair and yet they all sound exactly the same. So if you're thinking you're getting yourself a treat by getting yourself beats because everybody says that this is the brand no no it's not at least not this specific series of earbuds pass on this I wish somebody had written an actual review and not a butt kissing review to try to get free products cuz I feel like that's what a lot of people do this is not a product that I would want for free because it would just irritate me and I don't like lying to people and telling them that something's awesome when it's not and this is not awesome at all and I was so pumped I even did Snapchat this morning all excited when they came in these ruined my entire day!!,1.0 out of 5 stars
Trevor,"This was the most disappointing purchase I have made for wearable / all electronics in the past ten years. I was hoping the earbuds would hold up well - and be a convenient, wearable that wouldn't break the bank. That's not the case.The earbuds started making ""popping"" noises and muffled quality within the first 30 days of wear. I was using them on calls, jogs, and while working from home. The battery was surprisingly terrible as well - when I use my primary earbud (right side) while walking my dog, it starts having a battery warning within just 30 minutes of use.I wish I could get a refund. I replaced these on a trip with the HTC True Wireless Earbuds, and was surprised that the battery quality, noise cancellation, and overall expereince out performed the beats. That's a $17 dollar earbud pair out performing this $100 beats product.Not worth it one bit.",1.0 out of 5 stars
PetLover,"but they keep disconnecting, activating voice control on my iPhone and calling random people.  I've mostly had AirPods (original, 2 and pro) before these but before AirPods I was a diehard Beats customer.  When the puppy ate my last pair of AirPods I decided to go back to my beloved Beats. I simply cannot use them with my phone anymore. I've had them barely 2 weeks and they keep activating voice control (even though it's turned off in settings) and calling people (just now, while I was VACUUMING and no one was even speaking; I also have call confirm turned on so the phone is supposed to confirm before calling - that didn't happen either) so I have to retire them.  They sound fine. Aren't as comfortable as my AirPods but maybe my ears just haven't adjusted to their shape.  They stay in OK. When the battery gets low, the drop down is continuous, so that's annoying. I swiped up and acknowledged and tried all of the things to get it to stop notifying, but it just keeps going. Battery life is mediocre compared to others I've had. I'd keep using them except they've now initiated calls to 2 different people to whom I have no desire to talk. Sad to have to relegate them to the junk drawer/back up pair but that's all I can use these for now.",1.0 out of 5 stars
M. Barr,"I got these as a backup to my Sony Sony WF-1000XM4 noise-cancelling in-ear headphones so that's my point of comparison.I bought these on sale for $99, and, IMO, that was still too expensive. I think these are worth ~$60. The sound quality is fine, but they have disappointingly short battery life, connection quality, noise-cancelling, and noise-transparency.My main in-ear headphones are the Sony model, which is almost twice as expensive but I would say they are a 4x or 5x better value. It is sad how poorly these buds perform noise cancelling or noise transparency compared to the Sony buds. Also, if there's no sound on these buds for more than a minute, they will drop the beginning of sound from the next thing that plays. This is extremely annoying while you're doing something like duolingo or playing a game.I've owned a number of different Bluetooth audio devices from many price ranges and this pair is just not well situated for it's quality/features vs price. Skip entirely and don't even think about buying them for full price.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Linda Caballero,"HONESTLY not worth the hype or price. I've had issues with it since I first bought it. (Pink beats) I've now had them for 2 months.....The  beats company has yet to reach out about my warranty, I've reached out twice and no response ... I bought it when it was on sale ($100) so Amazon won't give me an exchange or replacement, because of the price difference ($160 regularly). The sound quality is ""just okay, not amazing"" I did like the noise cancelling feature. HOWEVER, it drains your battery (which doesn't hold 8 hours per bud (as advertised), but more like 3-4hours-on normal mode and doesn't last longer than 2-3 hours on noise cancelling mode..low battery life.) I bought some cheap headphones from Amazon a while back that we're $25, they hold 12 hour charge per bud.... These will not last you 24 hours. I don't know why these are considered some of the best headphones on the market. These crackle as soon as you are more than 5 feet away from them. They also disconnect out of nowhere randomly. I do not recommend these they are pretty bad quality. My son got a pair too (red) and his have static at random times. Overall, bad product. I do not recommend them, spend your $ on another brand these are not worth it. It really was a disappointment. DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE!!!!",1.0 out of 5 stars
Lavina R.,"These are not worth your money!! If you want an inexpensive great sounding earbuds I recommend the Sony earbuds line up. I bought some for $99 and they were 3x better than these beats. I only bought these cuz I thought these would be an upgrade. They look good but once they go in your ears it’s all downhill. The fit feels awkward not like other earbuds but I was willing to look past that. I turned on the music and was dissatisfied immediately. They have ZERO base I tried to go to settings and adjust the equalizer but turning base up just made it sound like white noise every time the base hit. The treble was horrible too. It was so nauseating and I could not fix it. It was giving the worst headache because of the high pitch frequency. I’m not exaggerating when I’m saying it gave me the worst headache. I gave it about an hour before I couldn’t stand the noise. Please buy from Sony or skull candy or even AirPods, they always have great quality.Update : if you bought these and have an iPhone I recommend buying the AirPods gen 2 pros , thats what I went with and man oh man for a $50 difference they are amazing, all the features the AirPods have and the sound are worth every dolla !!",1.0 out of 5 stars
Holly Montgomery Music,"I’ve had these for about four days now and they’re driving me crazy. I’ve tried every size of the earpiece that goes in my ear, and yet they fall out constantly. If I barely tilt my head, they fall out. But the worst part is that for the first day or two, it sounded like I was listening to an a.m. or transistor radio. I kept looking for settings on my phone to better the sound quality, but nothing helped. Then, after having one of them fall out yet again, I crammed it as hard as I could, very painfully into my ear - and the sound was better! But I only get decent sound if I physically hold and smash them as painfully hard as I can into my ear. I keep thinking I must be doing something wrong, but surely it shouldn’t be this difficult to figure out how to get AirPods to stay in your ears for any reasonable amount of time without having to painfully press and hold them in with my fingers.Oh, and also, brand new, a full charge only lasted about 2-1/2 hours. I bought them for a flight from DC to LA, and the batteries had already run out by the time I got past Tennessee!Am I the only one? I don’t understand all the good reviews.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Nate L,"TLDR; they only connect to the phone the first time 50% of the time. I am running the latest iOS and it just doesn’t work. It will show as connected, but cannot be used as an audio device. This has been an issue from day 1, but for me it’s not worth an extra $150 to get a better solution. But it’s annoying at least 1 time every day I use them. It’s functionally a broken product.As a less expensive AirPods/AirPods Pro alternative they work okay. The ANC isn’t bad but it has more ANC pressure than AirPods Pro (I had some that broke). Fit is good, not going to fly out of the ear. No, it doesn’t pause music when you take an earbud out. The buttons get pressed accidentally when adjusting. Reasonable audio quality.Con:The major problem is connecting. Like AirPods you open the case and it goes through auto pairing/waking up. It doesn’t work 50% of the time to connect it as an audio device. I am running the latest iOS this shouldn’t be happening, but it is, I just don’t have $150 extra to buy a functional product. It will be connected but won’t play through the ear phones. It will take 2-3 connection attempts before it will work as it should. It has been like this from day 1 and my gf who has a pair too, says she has the exact same issue. Go buy the Sonys, Bose or the AirPods Pro if you can get them, avoid these. Also you cannot just have one in the ear and one in the case. It just won’t let you. It’s better than nothing, but it’s not good. They also now randomly disconnect if audio is paused to a couple minutes.",1.0 out of 5 stars
The Neurotheologian,"This is so disappointing.  When the buds arrived, the case had enough charge to allow me to pair them with my phone.  In order to do any Bluetooth pairings, you have to have the buds in the case with the lid open, and the case has to have a charge.  The case has a built-in battery that you can use to recharge the buds several times before the whole setup has to be recharged.  In this case, the charge on the case gradually drained and I have never been able to get it to recharge.  The odd thing is that the buds will charge in the case when it's plugged in, but the case itself will not take a charge.  As you can see in the photo, the buds are at 100% charge while the case is at 0% charge.The buds come with a really short (think six inches) charging cord with USB-C on each end, but no power adapter.  I tried multiple USB-C power adapters that I already had, and even bought a new one (ensuring I got a 30W model), but the case will not take any charge whatsoever.  So, now I have to return the whole mess.Other than that, the sound is pretty good, the ear fit is mediocre and they WILL fall out if you're moving around, and the app is a joke.  The app has no equalizer or sound shaping, and the micro-function buttons on the pods themselves let you play/pause, skip forward, or skip back.  Press and HOLD the button?  That turns noise cancellation on/off/transparent.  Or, you can use the app to reprogram the buttons so that, instead of manipulating the noise cancellation, they activate the ""Voice Assistant.""Phone calls are difficult and the mic quality is very poor, but I bought these mostly for playing music so I quit screwing around with the phone call abilities as soon as I discovered that nobody could hear me clearly.  UGH - so disappointing.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Daniel Jenkins,I have a $20 set of earbuds that are a thousand times better than these things. The battery on the case doesn’t last much more than a day. The case for my cheap pair can literally go weeks. The same with the earbuds themselves. They have a garbage battery life of just a few hours so you pretty much need to alternate between the left and the right ear if you want to use them for any significant amount of time. Otherwise you’ll get a few hours of time out of them then you’ll have to take them out of your ears for a few hours to charge them back up. And you better hope your close to an outlet because chances are the stupid case is going to be dead. The sound quality is average at best and that’s only when they aren’t falling out of your ears. This is easily the most money I haze ever spent for a heaping pile of garbage. Awful! Awful earbuds!,1.0 out of 5 stars
Remey,"ATTENTION: My 1 star review is only to call attention to the selling condition and warranty of the product.I purchased a pair of these Wed 11/2/22 (received Thu 11/3/22) and I paired them and looked at the settings and product numbers. I noticed that the warranty coverage did not cover the full year; in fact 4 months of coverage was missing. So I contacted Apple Support and Amazon Support and both agreed that it was unusual for a “new” product and that it should be a year from purchase.As Apple wasn’t able to do much on their end regarding coverage on an already active product. The end result was to send the earbuds back for a ‘new’-“new” pair. They arrived today (11/4/22) and I repeated the process of pairing and looking everything over. There is still an issue with the coverage; it’s missing 9 days. That’s unacceptable for a product that is being sold and shipped by Amazon listed as ‘new’ yet having evidence of previous activity. That is not a new product by that definition, it is technically refurbished.While I have chosen not to repeat the process a 3rd time as 9 days is much less missing time then 4 months. I am not entirely satisfied because no time should be missing and a product listed and sold as new should be just that in its entirety. I am extremely disappointed with Amazon over the lack of transparency and honesty. So to any people who have purchased this product ‘new’ from Amazon recently, make sure you check the warranty coverage.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Will S.,I believe this item was refurbished and they did not  even do good job of doing so ! I probably could of done a much better job with a blindfold on and I would not lie to you about selling a product that was refurbished but then again I was not raised to have shiest of a soul that takes advantage of the everyday average consumer but then again I am not your everyday average person so this is for the underdog ! The person who so willfully goes on line in good faith looking to save a few dollars or get a deal using their hard earned dollars to find a deal only to find they have been bamboozled out of that dollar and their wallets emptied defunded with a product that was supposed to come as advertised new ! What disgrace what a sham  that these  even when Apple sells you a refurbished item there is a tiny disclaimer stating that the item was slightly used ! With that being said hold on to your wallets spending an extra 50 bucks to receive what you paid verses what you thought you were going to get is not worth the savings especially when defunding your wallets is all them came to do and give you not a new product but a refurbished one that they did a sheist of job to begin with ! Well Anyhoo like I said worth spending the extra 50 bucks at Best Buy when on sale with Amazon who knows what you will get but don’t get upset if you buy this product because it is never about the underdog it always about who is going to get over ! Quality over quantity is what I say I would rather have 5 good shoes then a 100 refurbished ones that fall apart at them seems the moment you buy them but that’s just me !,1.0 out of 5 stars
Joshua Graham,"I owned these less than 12 hours before returning them. Here are all the issues I’ve encountered so far:Bluetooth disconnects intermittently while using.Switching from car audio to earbuds causes a loud shriek in your ear.Earbuds don’t stay in your ears while working at your desk. Don’t even think about trying to run with them.Adjusting the earbuds or wearing a beanie to stop them from falling out causes songs to change, pause, or rewind.Sound quality is tinny and could use some work.These buds stick so far out of your ear you’ll look like shrek.Despite being 70% charged, they died after 2 hours.Save yourself the hassle and money.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Colton,"I love the product. I had a pair previously that I used daily. Great battery life. Noise cancelling is top notch. Very comfortable in the ear over long periods of time.My issue is with the shipping. This is the second pair I ordered after losing my first pair. I ordered same day delivery on Friday 1/20. I didn't receive the product that day, no big deal, hopefully I get it over the weekend. The next morning it said my package was out for delivery at 3:24 AM and arrived at my apartment on Saturday 1/21 around 5:30 AM. I live in an apartment with a dedicated mail room where packages are left in lockers and we have qr codes to go unlock it, only this time the delivery note says it was left on or near my porch (which I dont have in an apartment complex.)I requested a refund since I never received my product, despite the tracking saying it was delivered. I was told by three separate Amazon employees through the customer service chat that they would refund my order and I would see the funds in 3-5 days. That never happened. I followed up today and got in contact with the leadership team. They told me it was delivered and they can't do anything about it. The next piece of advice they gave to resolve this was to ""file a police report"".Very upset with how they have handled this. I have been ripped off for roughly $175. No product to show for it and no help from the Amazon team. Very unprofessional when it comes to customer service.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Joshua Blair,"These headphones have so many issues that it's insulting.Unable to Connect - They never connect automatically with iPhone like they are supposed to. Every connection demands a ""Forget this device"" and hard reset of the headphones in their case. I have had better headphone connectivity with the cheap gas station earbuds I bought for $20...it can't be that hard to figure out how to automatically connect. I have had these headphones for four weeks now, and even as my phone updates and the headphones ""update via bluetooth"" (I'm extremely skeptical they do) the earbuds continue to be nothing more than a nuisance with the beats logo on the side.Noise Cancelling - More like noise slightly reducing. It should be illegal for them to call anything noise cancelling because its obvious they have no idea what that means. If you want noise cancelling headphones, these are not it.Siri is always listening - Even when it is completely disabled on my phone. I shouldn't have to worry about my headphones making random calls every time it thinks I said ""Hey Siri"" when someone who walks by says something with literally any word that starts with an S.Battery Life - Weak. Just so weak.I used love beats. I've had beats for years, but these are a complete waste. I'm going back to the old Powerbeats. I feel bad for the people who designed the look and feel of these, they did a wonderful job. It's too bad the rest of the lot couldn't figure out how headphones work. Maybe they should give Sony a call.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Chris,"The brand name is Beats, and with a 40% discount for Black Friday, I still regret my purchase. When I first connected the earphones, they rarely paired instantly with my phone. The major issue is frequent disconnections. At its worst, the sound cuts off about every 10 seconds, making it unbearable. I have never watched a 10-minute video without interruptions, and it bothers me to the point where I'd rather watch videos without the earphones. The same goes for listening to music. Even with 3-4 minute songs, I've never experienced uninterrupted playback. If you use an iPhone, I strongly recommend investing an additional 50 dollars to get AirPods, as the connectivity issues can be frustrating with Beats.",1.0 out of 5 stars
SDC Assistant,"Honestly so annoyed and disappointed in this product. It wasnt a small amount of cash for me and I really wanted to invest in a decent pair but stick within my budget. I should have just saved more and spent the extra to be honest. The sound is great and noise cancelling is fair BUT I can't use them at all because they will not stay in my ear at all, what the heck! That's the least I would ask for at this price point! Did this product not get tested for that!? I have tried every different ear pad they gave and it makes no difference. Even sitting still they kept coming out and then you are constantly pushing them back in which is just irritating and defeats the whole point. I stupidly did not listen to the reviews and should have as it seems many have this issue. I also tried to give them more time to work so now can't return them and are stuck with a useless pair of earbuds I will can never use.*** UPDATE: Hoping others find this tip useful, so I experiemented and had some extra eartips left over from another pair of headphones (a chorded cheap pair) and decided to try them on these to see if it would be better. And guess what, they are far better! So has very much improved the ability for them to actually stay in my ear. Now it's not one hundred percent, they still slip out a little occassionally, but still much better than with the ones beats provided to the point I can actually use them now without 100 percent annoyance. So my suggestion is if stuck these like I am now, try to put other brand eartips on to see if it helps! You can buy a pack super cheap on amazon of various ones.",1.0 out of 5 stars
booklover68,I wanted a cheaper of pair ear pods for travel.  I bought these during prime week.  I can definitively say that the Beat Studio Buds  can not compare to the performance of AirPod Pros (2022).  I can accept that because as I stated I bough them for travel and the gym.  The real problem is that they don’t stay in my ear.  Even sitting down and doing nothing they keep falling out.  The minute I out them in they start slipping out of my ear.  It’s beyond frustrating any annoying.  I basically threw $80 plus down the drain.,1.0 out of 5 stars
TFIOS,"I got these thinking they were going to be worth the purchase, I was very wrong. The fit is very uncomfortable, the sound quality is okay. As nice as they looked and easy to connect as they seemed that was all it had going for them. My battery for both the earbuds and charger barely lasted an hour. Then the sound itself would disconnect a million times or the sound would just randomly go out. Very frustrating when I’m trying to study or do something and am just spending the majority of the time configuring them. Definitely not worth the purchase or the rave.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Buy Google pods instead... These are expensive garbage. See below for details on why.Beats was purchased by Apple then support and warranty was gutted, there is no support for these hardware or software wise outside of apple care.Hardware (0/5 stars): They don't retain charge, the pods themselves won't charge. OEM requires $70 to fix a single bud power issue or a case power issue.Software (0/5 stars): They demand you download the app then link to an email (probably to avoid 3rd parties refurbishing).

Dave U,"I really wanted and expected to like these, but it was nothing but disappointment in every way. Pulling them from the case took quite a tug, and the tips you pull on are slippery, so when you start to get release, they slip and snap right back in. Then, couldn't get them to pair! The most basic of steps. They even have step by step guide in iOS pop up automatically. And I've paired at least 200 devices in my day and even own the similar AirPods Pro. But these absolutely wouldn't pair to my phone or computer. It would try, then it would say ""Connection Failed."" It did manage to briefly pair with my daughter's iPod so we could try it out. There was nearly no difference whatsoever in Noise cancellation on, off, and transparency mode—which was shocking to say the least. But that could have been because it kept unpairing itself and making beeps as it tried and failed, so maybe the ANC was never on long enough to register. For the few seconds we had it, the sound was... fine. But then after moderate iPod success, I tried again to pair with my phone, but it wanted the iPod only now. So I had to make the iPod ""Forget Device"" and try again. Then, again, it wouldn't pair with anything at all. It would spring up asking to pair, but then it would fail every time. At a certain point, all of that hope and enthusiasm turned into ""Even if I get it to work at some point... do I want to live with this?"" No. No I do not. Life is too short for these to take up my time and sanity.",1.0 out of 5 stars
<3,"I don't know if I got stuck with a bad pair, but the sound quality is so bad. The music sounds tinny and echoey. The noise cancellation is not the best, it definitely works if you have nothing else, but this only highlights the terrible sound quality. I was looking forward to using these as replacements for my dying Airpods but they didn't even come close, it was extremely disappointing. To really describe how bad the sound is: the music sounds far away and like it's coming from a tunnel or metallic room, and they crackle when the pitch gets too high. If you're looking for something cute then yeah these work, but I wouldn't recommend them even to casual music listeners or as a replacement for good earphones like AirPods or wired earphones you can get for cheap. Considering the price, I would recommend going in person to test earphones or stick to a product you already know and avoid these.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Jason,"5 MONTH UPDATE:It has every single bluetooth and charging issue imaginable. I have to open and close, reset, forget on my phone at least 3 times whenever I want to use it. Most of the time my iphone can't find it and it simply won't connect. Whenever it connects one earbud is always dead. So sometimes I only have sound on the left, sometimes only sound on the right. It turns out that the case doesn't always charge both earbuds. Sometimes I open it and notice one is at 97% while the other is at 5% charge.All of this happened on the 5 month mark. I highly recommend you staying away from this. Also apparently this is the same technology used on Apple Airpods. My friends using Airpod Pros were complaining about the same issues.Here is my review shortly after using it about the performance of the earbuds which I liked and had given a 5 star based on it:My first initial though was that the sound quality was not impressive specially not for paying 100+ dollars. Oh classic Beats with their terrible music quality... Airpods or even the 20 dollar Apple cabled earphones have better sound quality.But they outperform all others when it comes to active sports. These absolutely do not fall from your ears and are very comfortable. They are also better at listening to podcasts compared to other brands.These are the best if you need earbuds as a runner in 2021 but if you care about premium sound quality and if you don't do active sports, stay away from these. Also I am pretty sure there will be better and cheaper running earbuds in a year or two. So if you are reading this in 2022, look for other running earbuds.",1.0 out of 5 stars
K,I wouldn’t buy these an upgrade to the pixel buds pro or AirPods is smarter. The first day one was buzzing which faded then three days later the left one started buzzing so bad I can’t use it. The battery is awful. The way they fit in your ear and in the case is poorly designed.

mom of two,"I've had these headphones long enough to know they can't be trusted.  The oval case falls out of your pocket, and goes skidding cross the floor, the headphones drop out of your ear and disappear in your seat, or skid across the floor.  It is only a matter of time before they are lost for good.  Worthless if you're jogging, or even walking briskly (fall out).  It often takes a ridiculous amount of time to connect.  Turn off, turn on, reset, repeat.  They are just not functional, and for the price, it's a cash grab, riding on a brand name and not investing in R and D.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Marissa R,"I typed out a whole review and it got deleted before I could post it. I don’t think it’s worth the energy to retype it all so I have bullet points below- battery life: brand new these lasted 2 hours max. The case only charged the earbuds about 1.5 times. When I frequently used these, I was charging the case 1-2 per day.- ANC: horrible. I bought a $15 pair of cheap earbuds for backpacking trips, as I don’t want to lose/damage any nice pair. And these $15 bud’s ANC are FAR superior than this $200 pair.- Microphone: kind of muffled. Also, the microphone picks up on every background noise possible. I can’t even talk on the phone with these if I’m in a windy area. The person on the other side of the call can’t hear me through the wind.I’m assuming some people gave these good ratings just because of the brand name.Do not buy these.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Thanks to the shape of the earbuds there isn't much resizing you can do, and I've found myself needing to adjust them more than I care to. The sound is fine. It's nothing you can't find in another brand. The worst part about these are the case. The shape and size isn't awful, it's the way it charges the earbuds. To charge the earbuds, they need to sit nearly perfectly in the case. It makes the earbuds a hassle to even charge, and if you move or bump the case, one or both of the earbuds will stop charging and connect to your device. It is beyond frustrating and no amount of troubleshooting seems to help.And the cherry on top? I can't return these because they HAVE to go through UPS pickup. There is not one other option to return these. If you live in a place that doesn't allow direct access for a UPS driver to knock on your door and take your package, you're stuck with this garbage.

Jeron Wilkinson,"From what I saw online, these were supposed to be great. I got them on sale for a hundred bucks and I can see why now. I came from AirPods pros to these and the downgrade was enormous. For starters, the pause button takes up literally the whole earbud so if you want to adjust it when they inevitably start to fall out of your ears, you find yourself skipping or pausing your song. Next, they are incredibly uncomfortable. I've had 20 dollar headphones that fit better than these. They hurt the bottom of my ears like crazy and I am constantly pushing them around. Even worse they look ridiculous in your ears!!!  I look at myself in the mirror and just see them sticking out looking absolutely ridiculous. I tried every ear tip it made no difference. The positive side is the sound isnt terrible, but then when you try and go into noise cancel mode from your phone menu, itll acknowledge it then go right back into the previous mode. Noise cancellation and normal mode feel the exact same. I would not reccomend these at all. It's like buying a medium popcorn at the movies.

Kamran,"Im overall very unimpressed with this product and it goes to show that you are paying 80% for the name and 20% for the actual buds. These should be 30 bucks at the most. The battery life is lower than they described which makes me believe I might have a defective product. I don't understand why the battery for my buds only last 2 an a half hours before I have to recharge, that is just unacceptable for the modern market. The sound is no better than those 10 dollar Panasonic wired buds actually I would argue that the Panasonics fit better in the ear and have better quality sound. The Beats Studio buds are an utter failure but they will keep selling because they have a deal with apple and they have great advertisement but unfortunately I am going to have to return these because they are cheap quality and over priced just because of the brands name. I will have to wait till the Sony ones go on sale again and hope that Sony at least has some integrity unlike beats which is a gimmick brand. Don't buy these if you expect a quality product with good sound.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Prosper Runner,"I was impressed by the fit and feel of the buds - they are among the most comfortable I've owned and I use buds about 4-6 hours per day. But, after 6 months the left bud suddenly developed loud and persistent static. I set up a repair through Best Buy, although it seems to be just a drop-off point for Apple Service. It was very inconvenient to set up both a drop-off and a pick-up appointment at the local store. After about 8 days, I received the buds back and it seemed as if there was nothing done. I logged on to my case online, and a whole 7 minutes elapsed between Apple's receiving the buds and their shipping the 'repaired' bud. Again, the exact same problem persisted. So, I have set up yet another case for Apple to mail a box so I can mail the buds in for service. I am not very hopeful for a successful repair. I wish I would have bought a more reliable pair. This will likely be the last set of Beats or Apple buds I will ever buy.",1.0 out of 5 stars

It seems every time the buds and my are phone is moving around the sound seems to disconnect and it’s the most difficult thing to deal with.2.

I’ve also bought a mock up pair ($25) similar to these name brand ear buds and i prefer them over the beats.4.

Jess,"I was excited to get these and I tried them out for a couple weeks. They are not comfortable, they do not stay in. I tried each size fitting and that's not the problem, you have to shove it so far inside your ear for the suction cup to work which is very uncomfortable, and then they still fall out. Having to adjust and push them back in every minute or so is so obnoxious because at the same time when you touch them, it will either skip or pause what you're listening to.

Truu simm,"This product works like AirPods, but after a while you start to find out that the most annoying thing is the AirPods notifications. Every 2 seconds it’ll show up and tell you what battery percentage it is on. When you push it away it only comes back faster, although it didn’t seem like a big issue at first but when I’m doing something important that involves my phone and I can’t get to a tab due to the notification it gets very annoying and angering. I’ve tried looking it up on how to turn it off on google and beats website there is nothing that helps. There is also nothing in the settings to help you at all. You basically got to deal with it or get new brand of airpods",1.0 out of 5 stars
Chloe,"So I bought these in hopes that I would receive more noise canceling and the battery would be a bit better, unfortunately I noticed after I bought them that they have buttons on the sides there’s way to get around the left one doing anything but the slightest press of the right and it turns on my Spotify music, the left one will turn down my volume when I try to sleep with them on as well. But the biggest complaint I have is the battery life idk if I got a used pair or what but the battery died within less than an hour even when they say they’re at 99% charge, I’ve restarted them , did everything the website said to , nothing! Also when I would sleep in them id roll over and if my ear pressed against the pillow they made this strange gurgling static noise like they were water damaged ? I seriously think they sent me a used product because the battery alone screams used or maybe it was a bad pair idk but I’m going back to my air pods I don’t want to go through anymore trouble finding another pair when I know what already works.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Max Gredler,Bought a pair of the white and black air pods. 1 for me and one of the pairs for my mom. While they started out great because I got them on sale for like $50 instead of $150 I was happy since I had saved money not buying apple AirPods. However as time went on I began to notice how bad they are compared to Apple air pods. First off you can barely walk 10 yards away from your phone without them losing connection and cutting in and out. Things like cleaning the house or going into the backyard to let my dogs out I couldn’t leave my phone on a charger and would have to bring it everywhere to not lose connection. The other big issue they have is they have a constant ringing sound when Bluetooth is connected. The ringing sound ranges from faint to moderate ringing but I’m noticing my ears now hurt after using them for few hours. Now that I saw these are selling for triple the price I bought them I figure I would make a review to save people money. Apple AirPods are very expensive but they are worth it quality wise.,2.0 out of 5 stars
Laurelin,"The case looks cool, but it is EXTREMELY slick. If I end up keeping them, I will put some tape across the case to keep it from literally flying out of my fingers.I followed all of the directions and made sure all of the needed resources were available. But these ear buds will not pair with my LG Android 8.0 phone. The app will not download and install from either Google Play Store or directly from the Beats manufacturer's website. (So, I can't install the firmware update.) Both the buds and the app are not compatible.Luckily, they do pair with my Amazon Fire tablet using just the Bluetooth protocols. The sound is great even even without adjustments. I have not tried to download the app there, because this tablet does not run the Android operating system. I'll give it a try later, but I'd be very surprised if it worked.I tried connecting them to a Windows device using just the Bluetooth protocols. It found my Meta Quest 2, but not these headphones.My husband managed to pair his buds to his old Android tablet, operating system 4.0. (Yes, I know it is not supposed to work with earlier versions, but it did, including the app. The firmware update did fail.) He has not yet tried with his Moto Stylus 5G phone (Android 13). I'll update if it works on his phone.So, bottom line, I can't use these earbuds on any of the many devices I have except for the Amazon Fire tablet. I'll contact tech support. Then I'll decide whether to return them or use them just on my tablet.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"These headphones are mediocre at best.  I am an avid music listener of all genres, and believe I know good balance, bass, highs and lows, and overall sharpness when it comes to trying out headphones.  I am not a consumer goods professional, but certainly a worthwhile critic.  When it comes to headphones and wireless earbuds, I have bought and used a number of brands from skullcandy, jaybird, bose, and of course apple.  That being said, here is my review:Noise quality: 3/5 - I was expecting a bigger ""punch"" being that the brand (even though its now owned by apple) was developed by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Lovine, and geared towards the rap and hip hop industries.  The bass and overall output of these headphones is quite indistinguishable.  There is no ""wow"" factor.ANC/Transparency mode: 2/5 - The ANC mode is BARELY noticeable.  If Apple's airpod pros were given a 8 on a scale of 1-10 in the quality of this feature (10 being superior), these would rate a 2 or 3.  My only reaction upon receiving and using these headphones and this feature is ""Seriously?"" Absolutely piss poor and a genuinely deceiving selling point.  It simply is not a feature.Comfort: Out of 5 starts, I'd give there a 3.7-4.  They fit snug and are comfortable for long periods of wear.  Without a stem like the airpods pro, they are less noticeable in your ear.  Sweat resistant, sure.  But by no means superior.  A cheap pair of skull candy headphones seem to stay in the ear better when sweating.  One drip, and they will slip.  However I will say that the sound quality is not as affected as some other competitor headphones when exposed to sweat.Functionality: 2/5 - Who is the genius that decided to make the front of the earbud the source of the controls?  It is the only exposed surface of the earbud.  If the earbud is slipping out of your ear, you cannot simply push it back in as this generates a ""tap"" and will pause/stop music.  Most annoyingly this will end a call.  It is ever more frustrating if lying down with your earbuds in.  Again, any pressure on the face of the earbud (the only exposed surface), will generate a tap.  This feature needs to be GREATLY re-engineered!  A big, hard slap on the back of the head to the six figure paid design team.When I bought these headphones on prime day, I paid $100.  I took the risk of trying something different, hoping for a good competitor to the airpod pros I was using at the time.  I am quite disappointed.  I would not recommend these to anyone, and would encourage consumers to buyer cheaper headphones, or spend the extra $70 for the airpod pros or beat fits pro.SEVERLY DISAPPPOINTED IN YOU apple,  beats,  and the designers and engineers of these headphones.  You certainly underdelivered! And well, we get what we paid for...",2.0 out of 5 stars
J. K. Tappe,"I bought these to replace a pair of 1st generation AirPod Pros.  These don't nearly measure up. The noise cancellation fades in and out whenever it pleases instead of being constant. That's quite distracting because it will do it in just one ear, and then in the other, so it's quite distracting. I've tried them with wind noise during bike riding, I've tried them when using power equipment, I've tried them in loud indoor environments. The noise cancellation fails to measure up to the AirPods in every test. The biggest failure was wind noise while biking; the cancellation is nearly non-existent, to the point where I could almost not tell a difference between having it on and off.  The one area they beat the AirPods is staying in the ear; they need fewer re-insertions per hour.  But if you really want noise cancellation, do not buy these!  I'd return to Amazon but they're not technically defective, they just suck.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Wunceamon,"Yup done with these want a new pair. yes they charge fast but they freaking stay connected in the case unless there put back perfectly and have fallen out and hit the ground so many times now the sound sucks and is glitchy at the slightest touch sad 😞 very very sad Read through the reviews I’m going to say the same exact thing every one else says. Doesn’t automatically connect, sometimes?!? 🤷‍♂️.base is big in these if you like base these are for you. And yes they fall out. They go from I’m in there nice and snug to on the ground in 2 steps then your looking for your ear bud on the ground somewhere??!!?? Lmao 🤣. Also battery lasts for 6hrs full blast :) . Also Also they have a noise canceling feature ( I work in a loud environment ) it works awesome at home 😎. One more thing for some reason I have not figured out why, sometimes when you brush up against the ear bud, like putting my hair behind my ear, it pauses the music very frustrating.",2.0 out of 5 stars
everardo leon,"I'm not a audiophile whatsoever so my review won't exactly pertain to those seeking deeper knowledge of sound quality. I personally thought the sound was pretty good but nothing that'd blow me away. I felt the same way about the noise cancelation: Ok, but I'm not writing home about it. In my opinion, I would have been satisfied with them at the $90 mark. The problem was that after only a week the left earbud started making a constant beeping/ popping noise that gradually got very bad very fast. Not long after the right earbud started to do the same thing. After a little research I found that this was a common problem amongst the colored Beats. So overall they are a fair pair of earbuds. However, if you absolutely need to have a pair of Beats for whatever reason I would suggest skipping on the flair and going for the simple black or white ones.",2.0 out of 5 stars
alexander shirrill-brewster,"Good lord where do I begin. First off the way they fit in your ear is just bad, they fall out within 5 minutes of use even when sitting still not doing anything, if you want these to stay in your ear you HAVE to buy silicone guards that have an ear hook. Second off the software integration with iPhone is terrible, 90% of the time when I pull the earbud out to listen to something it just won’t connect, you have to manually go into Bluetooth and connect it and even then sometimes it won’t connect. Half the time it won’t give you an actual cue or noise that the battery is going to die, it’ll just randomly die without any noise or anything making you think the video just stopped. Speaking of low battery holy crap these headphones have the most annoying use of low battery banners when using the your iPhone with these. You’ll be watching a video and every 2 seconds a banner covering the top portion of your screen will come up showing “% of battery left” from 19% to when they die. And when you look at the battery percentage in settings it constantly switches from 100% to whatever the actual percentage it is over and over causing the banners to pop up which gets very annoying if you want to see what other notifications you have and then you can’t even pull the banner bar down because it blocks your ability too. Also another note on battery life, these headphones only last a max of 4 hours per bud on medium volume without using any pass through or noise cancelling. My AirPod pros would last almost all day but these just have awful battery life for the price. And the sound quality isn’t amazing, it’s passable but nothing incredible. Even if they do use the same drivers and speakers from the AirPod pros, the pros sounded wayyy better than these.In my opinion, don’t buy these. They’re a waste of money, a very infuriating experience and just uncomfortable in your ear even with covers with ear hooks. Just buy the AirPod pros or anything else",2.0 out of 5 stars
Eric P.,"The overall quality of these is solid. About what I expected, really good noise cancellation (although one of the buds the noise cancelling effect is sometimes louder than the other, but usually they're good). The issue that I've had is one I've googled and found has been going on for awhile and it's that they have an issue connecting to iPhones, which... that's a pretty big issue to have. What this results in is a super frustrating case of typically needing to put in and take out my earbuds sometimes 3-4 separate times before they automatically connect to my phone. It might not sound like a big deal but when you're on the go and they have a magnetic case having to take them both out of the case and insert them, and then put them back, and then insert again etc. is very tedious. It's particularly frustrating because I've found that the issue is wildly inconsistent. Sometimes they connect perfectly, other times I have to repeatedly insert them and put them back in the case, and on a few occasions I've had issues where only one will connect at a time and I need to reset the earbuds.I've done research into the connectivity issues too and some of the contributing factors seem pretty ridiculous. One reported cause is if your phone has bluetooth enabled for awhile but isn't connected to anything it will have issues connecting. Another suggests that low battery for either the phone or earbuds impacts connectivity. I've had much cheaper buds in the past and never experienced these issues with other brands.Another issue I have with them is the battery display. The battery life is really good, but the on-screen indicator that pops up when the case is open seems to pop up at random for me. I've had like $30 wireless buds before that show the battery in the top right corner of your iphone next to the phone battery so long as they're turned on, and I'd honestly prefer that to this fancier feature that doesn't work all the time.The bottom line is if you don't experience the connectivity issues then these are high quality earbuds. If you do, the issue is so frustrating and frequent that you're better off looking elsewhere. I often find myself walking my dog, or to the bus for work and thinking that I'd rather just have wired earbuds that I know will never have any issues connecting than go through the steps of trying to get these to connect.",2.0 out of 5 stars
AF,"I read great things about these earbuds. I have a pair of Beats wired earbuds that I love, so I thought I'd give the wireless ones a try. I grabbed them when they were on sale and was excited to try them. Two things--I'm not a professional audiophile like some reviewers. Also, I have an earbud obsession and currently rotate through 4 or 5 different pairs. I work from home and use earbuds to drown out environmental noise and help me focus on tasks at hand. $149 is about the most I can tolerate paying for earbuds. I haven't found the perfect pair yet. I'm searching for THE ONE, and these, sadly, are not it.First, the battery life is atrocious. They barely last 3 hours. This is my number one gripe with these earbuds. I listen to audiobooks or music pretty much all day long, so I need something to last at least six, but preferably eight hours. I have a few much cheaper earbuds that manage to do this. Why the Beats can't do it, I don't know.Second, the noise-cancelling is good but not great. A lot of outside noise still slips through. Combined with the crappy battery life, this is annoying.Third, the case is obnoxiously difficult to open. It's smooth, slick, and has no indentation to allow you to open it by ""feel"" alone. Also--and this is the first time out of all the earbuds I've tried I've encountered this issue--the buds do not easily ""click"" or ""snap"" into their places inside the case. Every time, I've had to fiddle with them to get them to go in correctly. Which brings me to my fourth annoyance with these earbuds. The weird way the buds are designed is difficult to grasp, unless maybe you have tiny, little doll fingers and short nails. Also, they're not as comfortable to wear as I expected, given their tiny size.Finally, the sound, which should be the most important part, right? It's not so fantastic that I'm willing to overlook the above issues. Mediocre at best. No better than much cheaper buds I've tried.Only plus, was that they came in blue. I'm so tired of black, gray, or white earbuds and would love more fun color options. But the above stuff is more important than color.So, yeah, disappointed is the only way to describe how I feel about these.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Scottie,"I got these on a sale to be a backup pair. I hate them. The sound quality is so much less clear than my mifo 05 plus gen's. They do not block out noise well unless I have it on full blast and hurt my ears. They fall out easily and pushing them back in without the pressing pause by accident took some serious getting used to. The battery in the headphones lasts roughly 3 hours from full charge. 3 hours is hardly anytime at all!!! I have to go without music frequently while studying because the battery dies before I'm done. I have to recharge my beats after almost every use, or at least once a week if I'm just doing short periods of listening. My Mifo 05 I charge once every 3-4 weeks. Beyond all the annoyances of use, perhaps most of all, I hate that beats expects me to download an app to control something as basic as headphones--- uh no, you don't need access to my information about my phone and use just because I have a need for a very basic peripheral accessory to my phone. The only reason it gets a second star is that since it's a popular name brand, there are cute accessory cases you can get, that let me clip it to a keychain more eaaily than my other models that are less mainstream. So.... really nothing to do with the function, just their popularity.",2.0 out of 5 stars
maryreads,"For how frustrating these are to use with my iPhone 13, I might as well have paid 1/4 the price for a basic pair. The side buttons are way too sensitive and don’t detect when you take them out of your ear, so audio will keep playing but then pause or hang up a call if you so much as brush against the side. Call quality seems to vary and they’re not usable on calls if there is any background noise around you.The worst part is how glitchy they are though - they will randomly unpair and give an incorrect battery reading. I’ve had them just over 90 days and wish I had returned them. I’ve tried software updates, resetting my phone, unpairing/repairing, and it seems these earbuds just aren’t well designed or thought through. Very disappointed with all the high star reviews, hope this helps someone else avoid my mistake.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Kay,"This is my first pair of Beats and maybe it’s the hype but I am very disappointed. I use headphones almost everyday for 10 hour work shifts and gym so I need durable, comfortable and easy to use earbuds I thought these could provide that for me. But a little over one week in out of nowhere (no dropping or misuse) the right earbud is blaring a screeching noise. On a positive note I have small ears and the small ear tips that it comes with fits comfortably and I can make quick movements without fear of them falling out plus the case does charge the earbuds extremely fast and I am able to go 12+ hours without recharging the case. While listening to music the outside noise cancellation works great granted I only wear one at a time but unfortunately while taking a call the back ground noise seems to be very present because I’m constantly told to speak up because of it which I’m normally not asked to do while using my previous brand of earbuds. The compact look to them and the name drew me to make the purchase but not being able to last a week is terrible for the price. Hopefully customer service will be able to save this sell otherwise I will be getting a refund and purchasing a different brand altogether. I will update soon with results.",2.0 out of 5 stars
K.L,"I only bought these because I lost my AirPods and thought these would be a better fit in my ears.  Unfortunately, these earbuds disconnect each time I answer a call on my iPhone. After answering a call I need to select the beats earbuds through the audio menu.  Typically, I only wear one earbud at a time while at work.  I use them to answer business calls or connect to computer WebEx calls.  If my right ear becomes irritated and I attempt to switch to the left ear, callers cannot hear me and then I am not able to get the right bud to reconnect. This never happened with my AirPods. The sound is acceptable and fit is good, I just can’t handle the unreliable nature of the connectivity. I will be going back to the AirPod pros.",2.0 out of 5 stars
sunscreen queen,"I purchased these 6 months ago as an ""upgrade"" from a pair of Tozo earphones. Overall, I have been disappointed given that these cost 5 times more than the Tozo pair. When they work, they work well and the sound quality is superior. However, the sound is very frequently cut out or distorted. I have tried unpairing and repairing as recommended by Apple, but to no avail, this continues to happen. It is definitely the fault of the headphones and not my iPhone, as this never happens when I listen to audiobooks with a bluetooth speaker in my shower (while charging my iPhone in a different room). Of note, this is most annoying when listening to audiobooks as I have to continuously replay various portions, but it isn't any less perturbing when it occurs repeatedly while listening to music at the gym. The battery life is also pretty poor compared to Tozo; I cannot make it through a cross country flight without the headphones requiring to be recharged. The headphones themselves also provide no warning regarding low battery status so they will just abruptly die on you mid workout. The noise cancellation feature is average at best but in my opinion, just drains the battery. Overall, I cannot recommend these. Having already donated my previous pair of Tozo headphones, after much frustration, I have decided to get the newest edition of Tozo headphones.",2.0 out of 5 stars
ChicagoDave,"Edit:I no longer use these as the fit ops them turned to crap!! I couldn't get a tight seal on them, was constantly readjusting the fit and unfortunately, the return window closed before I started having these issues. If I was eating the left earbud would pop out due to chewing!! The sound wasn't that great to deal with issues, i even ordered other ear tips but those didn't improve these earbuds!!  In the long run these weren't good!!I've millions of bluetooth/headphones that i use for a loud work environment so volume and ANC is a big deal. the only drawback with ANC is that drains the battery and no one pair can get me thru the day. So currently i also use the Jabra Elite Pro 7 and I just get these Beats Studio Buds. The Beats replaced JAbra Elite 75t AND my AirPods Pro Max. The Jabra 75t are just old and don't work as well and the AirPods which have great sound and call just don't stay in my ears so I actually had to buy the plastic covers that go on the AirPods so they lock in better. For the price they should just stay in. Also the AirPods battery is done to about 4 hours! The Beats Studio Buds are small, even though the case is huge! The price isn't bad at $150, the Jabra Pro 7 was $130. I've gotten almost 6 hours out of the battery but it is brand new. The sound quality is really good, I played Whole Lotta Love by Zeppelin and it sounded great. The ANC is great too, blocks out outside noise great. I have smaller ears so the fit is good for me and I like the minimalist style of these.  Bose and AirPods are over $200 so like i said these are $150 and are really a bargain in my opinion!",2.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"I have been so disappointed in these. The sound quality is good but you have to charge them almost every day if you're a high-user like me, my old cheap bluetooth buds used to go for days before needing to charge the case. The case also has to be fully charged in order to pair them with any device, which is kind of nuts to me. The sound quality has not been worth the hassle, I'm going with a simple $40 pair next time.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Calvin Nguyen,"Since I bought these earbuds, I have used them a total of 5 times. The first-time use, they worked fine. No issues. The second time, the sound became EXTREMELY choppy, cutting in and out for the whole duration of use. I tried unpairing and re-pairing the earbuds - no help. I reset my phone - no help. I let the batteries on the earbuds drain to 0% - no help. I have an android phone, so I figured maybe they pair better with a different phone. So, I paired the earbuds with my brother's iPhone. Same issue: choppy and cutting in/out. We even used them in different locations (thought process was maybe certain areas affect the connection). No help.These earbuds have a great, sleek look. Aesthetically, they are pleasing. The battery life is relatively long. Very user-friendly and the app is easy to navigate.The issue is the functionality of the earbuds, which is the most important aspect. If I can not hear and enjoy my music/podcasts due to sounds issues, what is the point? I have always regarded Beats Studio as a strong, reliable brand with quality products. Now, I am highly questioning that notion.I do NOT recommend this particular product.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Carlos,"To start the noise cancellation is not very good. You can hear hissing that’s no bueno, the transparency mode is even worse it sounds like you’re hearing the world through a really old speaker and it’ll make you dizzy.So I use these in normal mode. That being said the sound is nice, not impressive but nice. They’ll sit kind of snug when they’re in your ear but the buds are huge! They’re heavy so they’ll fall/slip out of your ear if you walk, talk, chew, run, exercise or they’re in your ear for longer than 5 minutes.The charge time is not very good. I find myself having to recharge the case even after minimal use. Unfortunately I have not tracked the usage/batter life very closely but compared to AirPod pros it’s significantly less. The headphones and case combined.Putting them in is a small nuisance because the shape of the case and the headphones aren’t very pronounced. So I find myself sticking the headphones on opposite sides.Maybe this is just me not playing with blocks enough as a kid.I got these for about $100 on sale. I can’t imagine paying more or full price for this. Simply not worth it. They’re wish headphones with a premium logo.Remember this brand is owned by Apple and they will not compete with their own products so just buy the AirPods. It’ll be worth it.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Louwho,"3/22 update:: I have been using these headphones almost exclusively for the gym. Maybe these just aren't a good fit for my ear shape but the design of these earbuds is just awful. I've tried every single size variation the ear buds came with and these ear buds simply will not sit in my ears like they should. I am constantly adjusting the ear bud back into my ear so it won't fall out (falls out frequently while lifting weights). I can't stretch doing toe touches without them falling out. I can't lift weights without them falling out. I can't sit on the exercise bike without them falling out. The button on the ear buds is so incredibly sensitive that every single time I have to adjust it so it doesn't fall out that it causes whatever I'm listening to stop. So then I have to touch it again, which can cause it to fall out of place yet again no matter how gentle I am. These are the most frustrating ear buds I have ever owned. The sound quality is EXCELLENT! But the shape & design of the ear bud itself is so incredibly disappointing considering the price.Con:: I bought these mainly for the purpose of working out. I hate how large they are, they portrude way too far from my inner ear. So much so that my arm often bumps them when I'm lifting weights above head. Even when I am not lifting weights, I find that in constantly having to readjust them because they're falling out of my ears. I've tried using the different sizes ear bud covers but it does not help.I've had a little bit of static from the Bluetooth connection every now & then despite my phone being on me. It doesn't happen often, it was just odd it happened at all as my phone was sitting right in front of me. Not even a foot away.Pros: The sound quality is exponentially better than any other ear buds I've owned. They definitely cancel noise.The battery life is great. I've only changed them twice since I began using them in December...I like that the case recharges the ear buds even if the case itself isn't fully charged. The case charges very quickly too.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Sam G,"The sound quality on these headphones is great but the ear bud is huge and super uncomfortable. I was between AirPods & these, and bought these because they were about $20-30 cheaper at the time. The comfort of the smaller ear bud would have been worth the extra money. They do come with different size rubber pieces, and I did switch to the smallest one, but it didn’t make a difference.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Lydia,"I use these at work during a normal 8 hour day and have to charge these at least 2-3 times during my shift. They charge fast, but they die just as quickly.

boy david,"I wrote one review previously, but then I deleted it when I thought I had figured out the secret to getting them to pair with my device. Apparently there is no secret way to get them to pair to my device.After wanting these for a few months, I was delighted when they finally went on sale, and I bought a pair. I have a pair of beats headphones, which I love, and they have never given me any trouble at all. They are a little tight on my head, so I thought that a pair of beats ear buds would be the thing to get so I didn’t have to deal with that issue.The problem is that I could never get them to easily pair with my device.I would open the lid and they would appear to be connected and then I would put them in my ears, and nothing would happen. So then I would check the audio connections and apparently the sound was still selected for my iPhone, and selecting the earbuds didn’t really help. Sometimes they would connect, and sometimes they wouldn’t.Today I decided to go for a walk, so of course I wanted to wear my earbuds. After 20 minutes of trying to get them to connect, I gave up. I did get them to connect a couple of times, but the left earbud wasn’t playing any sound. So I got my device to forget them, and then re-connected them and they wouldn't play at all. So then I turned off my phone, and turned it back on and then the left wouldn’t work but the right one did. And I got so frustrated that I decided just to return them, which I did, and I still haven’t gone for a walk and now it’s been about three hours.I don’t understand how the headphones can be so trouble free, and the earbuds were the biggest pain in the butt ever.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Jackie,"Two pairs died after less than 60 days of use. Both pairs had the right earpiece experience extensive static and feedback.

joyce flood,The noise canceling feature is nice and so is the transparency feature. They are also comfortable. However the left ear bud constantly falls out of my ear when working out and sometimes just walking around the house if I don’t have it in tight. I’m glad I didn’t buy these at full price. If you want these for the gym and don’t want to have to mess with them all the time don’t buy these. I can imagine it falling out mid deadlift and dropping the weights on them. I may return them and try to get the ones that hook around your ears.,2.0 out of 5 stars
maryc,"Couple of things...easy to pair with my Samsung phone (galaxy 8).  I was told by callers that there was a lot of feedback although I didn't hear it.

Too bad.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Freya,"I don't often leave reviews on things, but I felt the need to for these headphones. The sound quality is great, noise cancellation is great, features are good.  Overall, I genuinely do enjoy them...when they charge, anyways.I've read troubleshooting, and, yeah, you could go through the pain of resetting them everytime you want to charge them, but that's really not ideal, right? That's not how they are supposed to behave, is it? Or, am I to believe that these were released with the intent that we go through several troubleshooting steps everytime we want the left bud charged?When they first arrived they were great, but the left side slowly became less and less likely to charge. It has gotten to the point that I do enusre that it is charging when I put them away. I press down firmly, I make sure it's clean, I go through the process and make sure that they are both charging.  I close the case, leave it be, and when I go to listen to music again I find the left bud completely dead while the right is fully charged.Every. Single. Time. Without fail!So, if you can handle the frustration of having to wait an extra 20 minutes before you can go on a walk or listen to music with both of your ears, then go ahead and buy these. Otherwise, maybe invest in a product that isn't so horribly flawed. And it's not just me! Googling that the left side doesn't charge brings up a managerie of different folks looking to complain, and all the answers are always the same ol' troubleshooting. Well, guess what? That's unacceptable.Fix the product.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Joelle Griffin,"Alright so I’m going to be honest, I was impressed with these at first. The noise cancellation is amazing, the sound and bass are pretty standard for earbuds, and I like the functionality of them. But, after having them for less than a year, they are no longer working. Flashing 3 red lights when I try to charge them, and they won’t charge or hold a charge long enough to do a hard reset. Trying to find customer support on here, they directed me to the Beats website. The Beats website had the exact same troubleshooting as Amazon, so they directed me to Apple. Apple had even more confusing instructions on how to fix, and are making me try to go in to get them inspected. I tried googling, looking on YouTube, and it seems like getting them looked at and repaired will be more costly than the actual cost that I got them for. (I also tried to fix by buying new charging cables like the website  suggested and it was a no go).I don’t recommend these considering the cost that they are. I was hoping that they would be an upgrade from the Beat Flex set that I have, but that set has outlived the buds.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Amari,"Was so exited so try these new beats, when I turned on noise cancellation mode I could still hear what was going on around me , music had to be blasting for me not to be able to hear anything , they honestly look super ugly coming out of my ears other than that the sound is good.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Tyler,"The sound is fine for my purposes, but it is a constant struggle to get these to connect to my iPad.  It's the only device they are paired with, but it usually takes 3 - 5 tries to get them to connect: pull them out of the case, back in, repeat, turn off BT, back on, etc.  It happens every night and I only get it on the first try 1-out-of-10 times.In addition, my video will suddenly pause out of nowhere and I have to push the button on one of the buds to get it to play again.  This will go on every 10 or so seconds for a few minutes until they finally decide to cooperate again.I regret not just getting another pair of the cheaper BT ear buds the Beats replaced.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Kolby,I got these before I went to work. I was able to have the right one in at work all day and was SUPER impressed. Until I got home and put the left one in to hear a continuous whistling sound. I am returning and ordering them again in hopes I just got a bad pair. If so I’ll update my review because I WANT these both to work. The sound off just one is amazing.

I’m hoping replacement pair will prompt me to update this review. I want to love these.,2.0 out of 5 stars
Leslie J Henry Ayau,"The sound is great.  They are a little big and can fall out if you are at the gym for instance.

If you enjoy making your friends colleges and family feel they are bleeding from the ears, this is the product for you.

My names Erin,"Look I’m real upset at myself for not returning or saying something right when I unpackaged these. But I also want to say I don’t want to get my emotions out over reasonThe reason Im upset is because the left ear bud right off the bay has had a ‘white noise’ sound. Got worse over time and started getting that high pitch buzzing/beep, but only happens out of the blue and creeps up and down. I have to readjust it however and it’ll go back to white noise at a minimum for a little. Other problem is the noise cancelation settings..it automatically switches on its own RIght after I switch it to one setting. I’ll watch it too. I was going to screen record it but it wouldn’t make much sense sense you can’t tell if I’m using my finger or not lol. But seriously got upset and at first I was supposed to get it on a good deal. Had some troubles for that day with Amazon the app it’s self I’m guessing. But then once I was finally able to get it to approve and pending the price goes back up to regular 😒😐and I feel pretty stupid but again I’m trying to put my feelings aside.

On occasion, once they manage to disconnect the earbuds automatically connect to devices even while still in the case. Double checked device settings and Bluetooth setting with no success.

river,"Sound -The sound of these headphones isn't terrible. Being simple they do what you would expect beats do, handle bass well. While they never felt quite as full as a set of over or on ear headphones, they get the job done. they seems to sound dull though for non musical productions though, as I noticed Youtube and other video sources sounded duller then I expected, especially compared to my Bone Conduction headphones which is saying something. That is to say they live up to the beats stereotype.Comfort -Comfort is where they let me down. The tips are limited, and since they only use the in canal tip and by design put all the weight on the lower parts of the ear. I honestly found this discomfort from this to be annoying and returned them mainly for this issue. I know not everyone has these kind of issues, but if you find Apple iPod headphones from the 00's uncomfortable, I don't think this will be for you.Performance and Other notes -A few days into trying this out, playing with tips to try to find some comfort the left headphone refused to connect, with no quick fix I could see. I also had sync issues between the left and the right, and some static break into the headphones. I know this isn't the rarest issues with true wireless buds, but I had these for 2 days and experienced a lot of issues for that time. I have had much better experience with $50 and under headphones and these cost $150 ($100 on Black Friday). All around they are simply disappointing. They are wonderfully simple to use, the simplified design from using a single touch button on each bud is nice (though more control over the button would also be nice). I wanted to like these, but Apple/beats failed to deliver with the product.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Aiden Roby,"Ok, so don't get me wrong: these are great earbuds for being on a somewhat budget but be warned there are issues with them sometimes! AKA MINE.  I bought this brand new, and they arrived in good timing. First issue arrives when I put them in; none of the ear tips have a perfect fit, and I know that most people like a perfect fit for comfortability. I got used to them though, so not too major of an issue to me.  Around a week in, the Bluetooth started having issues, where it would randomly connect to phones that it's never connected to before, or where it would connect to my phone while Bluetooth was off, or I didn't have them paired. That list goes ON AND ON.  Biggest issue was that about 2 and a half weeks in, the right earbud made a popping noise, and from there on out, every time I wouldn't even have the earbuds connected to my phone, but the right earbud would make a static sound, which would eventually turn into a popping AND static sound mix.  For only having these earbuds 2 weeks, I'm MAJORIALLY. DISSAPPOINTED.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Mary Hahn,"the noise canceling is a given, as worse than having the noise.the buds play on their own even when not in ear canal.they dont stay in ears even at a resting state no matter what ear adapter used. this is after years of using the stock adapters for ear buds for over 20 years.there is one corresponding button, one each bud, on each bud that does the same thing; pause and play. It is one big giant button that on both buds that a single tiny button has done on every bud i have ever used. it replicates the exact function as any other brand does and the other brand manages to have 3 other buttons that do completely different functions intuitively.with these buds you have two giant buttons with one single toggle option in place of 4 buttons with natural different intuitive functions.also they dont stay in the ear for more than 15 minutes of even just driving on a hwy. you will spend more time searching for the ear buds under your seat than you will spend charging.the charging case is bulky compared to less capable cases and you will have to find a high strength but delicate pair of pliers to remove the buds from their magnetic charging cubby from the case.i am more satisfied with the, last resort, impulse buy isle $19.98 that i was forced to buy instead of these mental torture devices.next ear buds will be jabra for sure. unless they have followed suite. then i will just listen to the sounds on real life as they happen.these are nothing but a good reason to blame all your life problems on.",2.0 out of 5 stars

If you’re doing cardio or HIIT workout, count on them falling out. Yes I’ve tried different sizes to fit my ear and none of them work.-case is bulky for such small earbuds-the entire part of the earbud that sticks out of your ear is the button that controls pause/play, answer calls..etc. so pushing them back into your ear inevitably pauses the music and sometimes answers phones call.-not good for sweat/waterEveryone is different but I hate these.

12775,"They’ve got the nice audio and has nice canceling abilities but those pros don’t don’t out weight the cons. I’ve had these headphones for a long while and have even sent them to get serviced to no avail. The earbuds are ridiculously finicky when it comes to connecting to Bluetooth. Sometimes, they’ll even connect to my phone for a half second before dropping. I have to basically set the buds on my screen face for a good minute before testing to see if they’re connected. When I sent them in, they said there was nothing wrong with the Bluetooth so I guess that’s just how it is. Additionally none of the silicone tips fit my ears and trying to shove the buds back in often leads to be accidentally pausing or skipping. Waste of my money.

Spencer Ward,"I was excited to buy these Beats Buds, but after receiving them it didnt take long for the excitement to go away. I had high hopes for these Beats Buds because I own a pair of wireless Beat Studios that ive been using since 2013.These Beats Buds didnt stay in my ears so I bought ear hooks and foam pads from 3rd parties off of Amazon to make them work. And this is alright but I need to take the hooks off and the ear pads so I can put the buds back in the charging pod for charging. This takes alot of time, so the orginal design isnt good.I rarely have issues with my wireless Beats Studios connecting to my Iphone but with these Beats Buds it has been a different story. Dont really know what changed but they dont always connect to my phone when I turn them on and it can be a real hassle on some days trying to connect to them.When these Beats Buds have worked then they have been good.

Sibelius,"These buds are awful. They're way over-priced considering their very low sound quality. They sound very much like the low quality of AM broadcast radio from the mid-20th century.Neither the buds, nor their case have any flat/textured surface. This makes them *extremely* slippery in your fingers. Very difficult to handle without dropping them. It's especially difficult to get the buds in and out of their case, as the magnets that hold them in are pretty strong, so the magnets pull them out of your fingers. Basically you have no control over your hold on the buds because they're so slippery. There's nothing your fingers can grasp onto.In order to pair w/your phone, you need to have the case open, and be in close proximity to your phone. Because the case has no flat surface, and the lid has a spring mechanism that snaps itself shut far too easily, you'll need both hands on the case itself to pair. This is a *really* poor design and I absolutely hate it.Matter of fact, I absolutely hate both the buds, and their case.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Ted,"I don't have a lot of time to be writing reviews but for these I had to take the time. I should have taken heed on the previous reviews.First...for Beats I really expected better sound. They don't sound horrible but they certainly are not as good as the Tozos that I had previously. I'm very disappointed in the lack of bass. I even tried adjusting the equalizers on my phone and PowerAmp but with little luck. They just don't produce much bass. They sound very flat.Second...if you listen to these on your phone the volume is alright. I was planning on using these with my TV as well as my phone. When I connect them to my TV the volume was really low. I increased the volume of the TV to max(100) with fear of blowing my ear drums out. I didn't have to worry about that at all. It barely raised the volume of the earbuds. There is no way to increase the volume on the earbuds separately.Third...the noise cancelling is atrocious. I'm only saying this because I have something to compare it to. I've had other cheaper ear buds w much better noise cancelling ability.If you are looking for a pair of earbuds that you will ONLY use w your phone and you don't care about volume control or noice cancelling these are pretty good. They pair up fast, they connect fast and they are pretty comfortable but the sound quality isn't very good and the lack of volume control was a deal breaker for me.I gave them 2 stars because they stay in my ears good otherwise they would have gotten 1 star.I'm returning them",2.0 out of 5 stars
Ashley W,"let me start off with these are good earbuds. they have good sound and are a good quality. however i ordered these because i wanted noise cancellation. their noise cancellation is okay, but not as good as apple air pods. the shape of the airpods are not comfortable for more than 45 minutes, and it is impossible to adjust them in your ear without pushing the button. i paired them with my iphone and had to select the options for what the buttons do every time i put them in. overall i would recommend if you don’t wear for long periods of time and don’t care about noise cancellation.  just not for me.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Aamir Khan,"I had recently been using some $30 bluetooth earbuds up until I lost them, so I decided to finally use some higher quality earbuds. In terms of sound quality, these are solid. Comfort is pretty good too. But whoever designed these headphones screwed up BIG TIME. You can't turn on the earbuds without removing them from the case, and they will constantly remain on until their battery life is drained unless placed back in the case. There's no way to increase volume from these headphones. The noise cancellation is terrible. The battery life is pretty pathetic (usually 2-3 hours) especially in comparison to other earbuds which can get you 6-8 easily. Also, when the case runs out of battery, you're screwed. Even if the earbuds themselves have battery, you can't actually turn them on unless the case is charged. On top of this, when the case isn't charged, everyone near you will get constant unending notifications on their phone about how the case isn't paired with a phone yet. It will drive you and everyone else mad, because you can't do anything about it. The button to pause on the headphones is so sensitive, even adjusting them in your ear will set if off. Honestly, save yourself some time. Buy some earbuds that can turn on and off with the earbuds alone, last longer, have volume control, and don't constantly cause problems when the case is out of battery. Before these, I had enacfire E60's, which I dearly miss. Very similar sound quality, and had every feature you would expect and want on earbuds.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Fatima,I currently have the larger over the ear beats which has an amazing sound so I thought that these would be good also. These ear buds are not easy to put in your ears and if you are a lover of music and enjoy hearing the power of instruments you will be disappointed in this product. You are limited what you can do with these ear buds. You have to be mindful of them because if you are running they can fall out easy. I decided to only use mine indoors which is actually not what I purchased them for. I absolutely do not feel that they are worth the money I paid for them. If I had to suggest a price it would be $29.00. I am very disappointed in these ear buds and would not recommend that anyone purchase them for any activities that require a lot of movement because you will definitely loose one  or both of them if you are not paying close attention to it moving in your ear before it falls out. Beats are great but not this product. Also you are only given a tiny cord which was not compatible with my iPhone charger. Something good about it is that it pairs with your iPhone instantly once the case is open and near your phone.,2.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon Customer,"These headphones frequently disconnect and reconnect to the device at random. The earbuds don't function properly when the case runs out or is nearly out of power even though the earbuds themselves are mostly charged (note this doesn't happen every time, but enough to warrent mentioning). Sometimes the earbuds all together unpair on their own and have to be reset. Their button functionality is mediocre at best and lacks simple functions that earbuds at half the price have. I will admit the sound quality is good, but not so much better than cheaper competitors that it's overly noticeable. Consider me disappointed. I use an S20 which is a new enough generation of phone where I can say that the issues are unlikely due to a compatibility issue.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Couldn't adjust the volume from my earbuds, no customizable equalizers.

Cymon,"I've owned these Beats for just over a year. I'd like to start by saying that the sound quality is phenomenal. However, after a month or 2, I started to notice that only one ear bud would be playing sound, but quickly turning my Bluetooth of and back on would fix it. Around the 6 month mark, the issue became more frequent, and the simple disconnect/reconnect was not solving it. This is where it got annoying. I would constantly have to juggle each ear bud in to the case, take them out, check the sound, disconnect, reconnect, update the app... you get the point. VERY annoying, as I use them for work calls primarily. At this point, it's a multiple time per day struggle that is just not worth it anymore. Ordering something else.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Martin Anthony,"I was happy to find these on sale, however, the sound quality is not good when in the ""off"" mode. It's hollow and tinny.

kimcramer98,"I want to like these, but there’s a really bad design flaw. They don’t fit in my ears and if they slip even a little and I try to gently push them back in, the “b” is trigger happy and hangs up on my phone calls or stops my music. There is no way to go back a song unless you have access to the device playing music. Not user friendly. I can’t move when I’m wearing these or they will fall out, so forget about working out or running or even gentle walking really. Sitting on a plane perfectly still, they fell out of my ears 15+ times in less than 2 hours. It’s incredibly frustrating and beats doesn’t seem to have any solution other than to say that my ear canals must just be too small, despite the fact other in ear buds fit fine and are much more comfortable. Even if I jam these in my ears, they’re uncomfortable and cumbersome. They’re heavy, not light like you would expect. The correct way to wear them to show the logo doesn’t make sense with the shape of the ear. Switching back to another brand. The noise cancellation is a nifty idea, but the quality is not comparable to over the ear headphones. The transparency setting is not much better and it’s complicated to switch between the two. I’m tired of not hearing well and the buds falling out and trying to hold them in causing me to accidentally hang up over and over and over again on work calls and video calls.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Hannah1003,"So the Airpod pro noise cancellation is better. Waaayy better.These are okay, the battery life didn’t seem to last as long as they claim for it to last. NOT MY PAIR!It literally lasts about 4.5hrs maybe 5hrs..Not 6 and definitely not 8hrs. I tried it without noise cancellation, and it still didn’t last that long. The case goes down quickly too.I mean not extremely quick, but it doesn’t exceed my expectations of battery life …AT ALL.Airpod pros last for as long as it claims to last and the noise cancellation (i reiterate) is better. As well as the transparency.However, i CAN say the music sounds good with the beats (mostly on my iPad than my iPhone), that’s the least it does. It gets loud with music. But that’s just truly it. Not worth the hype.Also, it takes a while to pair with my devices, my iPhone and iPad.My experience is just so different. Airpod Pros sound extraordinary with my iPad, the beats are just OKAY. It doesn’t instantly connect like my Airpods. I have to fondle with it a bit to get it to FINALLY decide to pair, even with the devices right near me. I’m slightly disappointed. I know it’s not defected, or anything, it’s in fine condition. It definitely just isn’t what it was chalked up to be.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Brenda S.,"Why do they charge so much for these? I have a pair of Tozo's that are WAY better. These headphones are unstable and the battery life is garbage. The right headphone constantly dies randomly and loses it's charge almost every night even though it's stored in its case. AND even though they're in the case they'll randomly connect to my phone and run the battery down. AND as soon as I open them they start up and play music from my playlist before I've even put them in my ear. AND they're hard to get in and out of the case. They're not worth it. We bought the more expensive Beats also, thinking those would be better.... Spoiler alert: THEY ARE NOT ANY BETTER. These ARE NOT Apple headphones, these aren't even holding up to some of my Wally World headphones. Sad that they have any affiliation with Apple. Skip these please.",2.0 out of 5 stars

El Papi Oso,"I read and watched a bunch of reviews before purchasing these. They are decent. You can tell they are a half-step above the generic earbuds, but they still suck. Here’s why.The sound quality is not great. Deeper bass sounds good but it’s doesn’t highlight all the lows throughout the songs. The vocals and other tunes outside of the bass just don’t sound crisp or noteworthy. The noise-cancellation is about as good as the generic buds are. They don’t come anywhere close to matching the AirPods Noise cancellation. They don’t sound well on the other end of a conversation either. People can tell when I’m talking to them with my headphones in. Sometimes they make like a little screech noise if I shove them into my ear after they start to fall out.If you’re working out, maybe try the Powerbeats. I like those. They sounds as good and they stay in your ear. If you just want some good earbuds to talk and listen to music on, the AirPods are much more worthy",2.0 out of 5 stars

PJBlitz,"I purchased these because my last set of wireless earbuds was stolen while I was working a shift. I like the Beats brand so I thought I'd give them a try. First thing I noticed when I opened the package was the hinge and lid. It just feels really flimsy, and with the case I purchased it's added more strain.The sound quality is good, however I personally do not like having awareness mode on by default whenever they're powered on. The button function is also extremely sensitive and they stick out, easy to bump. Also not super comfortable.Lastly, they guzzle battery power, even if I'm not using them. My other pair of Beats (Beast solo wireless) is nearly 6 years old and their battery life still lasts literal days with frequent use before I have to charge them, and then it only takes 20-40 mins to get them back to full.All in all, very aesthetical, but poor execution and functioning.

Ruby Lue,"I wanted to love them, I really did. But I didn't love them enough to pay that much of a price tag for them to have so many downsides.So I will say they sounded pretty good volume wise, the noise cancellation was pretty decent, BUTThey have No battery life feedback. So you have no idea how much battery is left in the headphones or the charger.ANDThe charging cable is a joke. Its tiny, and you have to buy an additional charger block just to charge it, and who uses a USB-C cable?? So when the batteries die, you better have that special charging cable on you with the wall block or some kind of USB adapter. (if that even exists) I have multiple chargers for various items and this fits none of them. This was pretty big turn off for me honestly. it was a little thing that made no sense as to why they did that.No volume control on the headset. I saw cheaper models with this option, so again why?And the  most important thing, they're not very comfortable. I have small ears, and its not about the tips, its about the actual base that sits in the ears. I cant wear them for longer than a few minutes without them hurting.So if you don't care about money, comfort or battery life, then these are great.

Devin,"tl;dr - spend the extra money on air pod pros if you can afford it.I've been using airpod pros for a while now and was looking for another pair but didn't want to pay the high cost. I read that other than a few subtle features, the beats studio buds were similar in all respects to the airpod pros and notably $100 cheaper.After trying them for a few hours, the differences are notable.1. It's surprisingly unintuitive how to put them in your ear. This sounds silly (and will likely be solved over time), but they just aren't as ergonomic as the airpods.2. Because the fit is weird (even after trying the various tip sizes), I found myself constantly trying to adjust them, which caused me to inadvertently hit the button on the bud. Given the low surface area on the bud, I can see this being a constant issue.3. They kind of hurt my ears after a while. To the point I found myself actually not wanting to wear them. Never had this issue with extended wear with airpods.4. More of a nit, but the case is slightly bigger, but feels a lot cheaper. Also, it took a minute to figure out how to put the buds back into the case. Again, something that will be solved over time as I use it more, but speaks to the lack of design that you come to expect from apple products (yes, I know Beats existed before Apple acquired them).That said, pairing with iphone was seamless (as expected), and I didn't notice a stark difference in sound quality (mostly listened to audiobooks so far).Overall, I wish I could just return these.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Tru,"I’m only comparing this from other beats products.I bought 2 of these for my son and for myself just around the house. I own many different beats products and I have to say. These are the worst in my opinion.Yes they fit great in the ears, battery life is eh ok sound is eh ok. Talking on the phone is decent. Even Noise cancellation is eh.I will say for it’s price then yes I’d would be overall a decent pair of buds however coming from the Beats Pro and the fit pro.I personally do like them better than AirPods. But when it comes to be beats brand this is definitely on the low end of the line.Pros. Comfort, size, battery life decently ok. Phone conversation decently ok. When active it stays in my ears. Working out as in lifting weights, push-ups sit-ups, dips and pull ups etc. I don’t know about running kuz that I don’t do.I love how these connect to my iPhone on seconds and also love how they switch to the different systems im using. iPhone iPad MacBook Mac mini.I will say they’re better than the Beats Flex.The cons I listed earlier, but I’ll write them again.Noise canceling isn’t the best in beats line,Music output, it’s just missing that passionBattery life  don’t expect to fly from SFO TO MIA on a single charge.My biggest issue is the noise cancellation.

Liz,"I use headphones everyday, multiple times a day for shows, music, podcasts, sometimes sleeping. The noise cancellation isn’t great, but I didn’t want these for that.My biggest annoyance with these is battery life. It says 5hrs for headphones and 10 for the case. The headphones drain when you only use 1 for some reason, and will only last 2 ish hours, maybe 3. I do not understand the case charging. It will tell me it’s at 0% and I won’t charge it. I look a later and it says it’s at 30%. I don’t know how that’s possible. It’s honestly just annoying. The headphones charge fast and so does the case so it’s not a HUGE deal. Sometimes the low battery glitches when watching shows on my phone and it will pop up 30 times in a row.UPDATE: I just wanted to emphasize how ANNOYING these headphones are when they are low battery. I took away a star for this. It is so annoying that I’m debating giving these away! If a single headphone or the case is below 20% battery they will NON STOP show a banner for low battery. It pops up for 5 secs then goes away for 2, comes again. You cannot stop this pop up unless you disconnect, charge the case, then reconnect. It’s so pointless like just let it die?? It’s a small detail that’s SOOO annoying! Rant over.As for connecting, I have no issue with that. It connects effortlessly between my Mac and iPhone.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I like the button features on the earbuds and they are easy to press without feeling like you are shoving the bud down your ear. The sound quality is chefs kiss and keep in mind I like breaking my eardrums with music.cons aka the breaking point for me: The battery. The buds themselves last a while, which is great but the case dies sooooo fast. I feel like I am always charging it (and I am) which is bizarre because battery life is the feature they emphasize with the product? Also you sometimes have to play with the earbud and make sure it is in a perfect spot in the case or that bud will not charge. I also feel like they kind of stick out of your ear. I feel like at least airpods have that natural look but these remind me of ear plugs",3.0 out of 5 stars
Yahdie,"Overall, I find the Beats Studio Buds to be okay, but that’s pretty much what I expected EXCEPT for the battery life. Battery life is advertised as “up to 8 hours of listening time”. I have yet to get that many hours - or even close to - of listening time. The most I’ve gotten is 4 hours, and that’s not with continuous listening. I don’t know whether this is a short coming of the headphones, or whether Amazon sent me a “used” headphone that they sold as new. Either way it would be bad since it would amount to misleading advertising from either Beats or Amazon. Or maybe I received a “lemon”. Unfortunately, the return window has passed so I have to keep them. I own a pair of Beats Fit Pro as well, so I have a close “relative” to do a comparison (I get on average approx 6-7 hrs. of listening time from the Fit Pro). The Studio Buds are not premium headphones, but generally you get what you would expect from Beats - pretty good bass, noise cancellation and overall sound, just not as good as the Beats Fit Pro. One of the main reasons I purchased the Buds is because they don’t have the “wingtips” (the little tips that help secure the headphone in your ear). On the Fit Pro they sometimes bother me.  On the Studio Buds, once I found the correct fitting eartips (it comes with 3 sizes), I got a good comfortable fit with no worries of the headphones falling out even while working out. Again, my main issue is with the battery life.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I always pay attention to it when I open the case to avoid damaging it.3. If you like to lay down with the earbuds on, it is impossible to put your head on the side because it is sticking out and u push the button on the side that pauses the track.Overall it is good earbuds works well and has a good sound to it, good for casual activities.

Thomas Edwards,"After losing my 1st Gen AirPods Pro to my son, I needed some wireless headphones, preferably with decent noise cancellation since the guy who sits next to me at work likes to eat ice for no particular reason. I went with some Beats buds - these and a pair of Beats Fit Pro. The Fit Pros had some better features but I wasn’t sure about the fit and the price, as the Studio Buds had a better look to me, a better price point, and looked as comfortable as my previous AirPods Pro. Figured I’d try them both and report back. My notes on the Studio Buds below:The good:Feel: the Studio Buds sort of twist into the ear canal, and surprisingly stay in place pretty well. I used the smallest of the three supplied ends and they still stayed in better than my AirPods Pro ever used to. I had them in for over an hour straight with no discomfort.Case: the oval case was secure and the buds locked in tight with the internal magnet. The smaller case fit into my pocket well.Look: the color options stood out. Honestly, the red color of these made me want to keep them over my grey Beats Fit Pros. There’s something about “Beats” and that red color.The bad:The sound: I mean that’s what we’re here for, right? I take teleconference calls with these and that’s fine, but if I play music - especially something bass heavy - and the difference between something like this and the Fit Pros comes in. It doesn’t sound that bad on its own, but carrying the Beats name and a three figure list price you expect something more.Noise cancellation: again, this is a case of “it’s fine, but you expect more.” This doesn’t reach the ability that the Fit Pros or AirPod Pros did. Maybe I’m asking too much for something not labeled “pros,” but again - for the price, you expect more.Battery charge: these seemed to drain pretty fast. Even with limited usage I was down to 70% before lunch if I wasn’t putting them into the case to charge during any downtime.VERDICT:Like I said in the title - I wanted to like these, I really did. But I really can’t justify paying full retail price for these. They’re an Apple product so they pair with iPhones and other iOS devices pretty easily, but they lack the H1 chip so they lack certain features that AirPods and other Beats earbuds have. If you’re spending this much, you might as well spend a little more and get the Fits Pro or AirPods Pro and get better quality. If you don’t need the high end sound quality, look for something from a third party like Anker for half the price.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Iliana,"Unfortunately, I am not impressed with these buds.

Granted, I do have small ears, but I am using the smallest rubber inserts they have. Also, I am not impressed with the quality of the sound, my wife's $29 pair of ear buds sound much better.

My other earbuds would stay in after eating, taking, or any other activity.

If you are using these for just a short period of time then, these are very good.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Timothy Wang,"Honestly, I really wanted to like these earbuds. I purchased these for a 30$ discount but just missed the 40$ discount. Unfortunately, I ended up returning them as they just didn't cut it.1. SoundI was really underwhelmed with the sound of these earbuds. Upon receiving them, I immediately wanted to see what the sounded like. To my surprise, the sounded shallow, and not immersive at all. I have a pair of fake air pod pros and even they sounded better than these. Now, I'm not one to require an insane amount of base, but this was ridiculous, these earbuds had horrible sounding low base. It relied too much on higher frequency sounds. This make the sound seem like it was coming through a filter or like you were listening through a wall. This is especially disappointing as Beats are supposed to be catered to base-junkies. I was also surprised when I found out that these earbuds cannot get very loud. I don't think these earbuds ever touched 90 decibels for me. Even though I try not to listen to music too loud, I would like the option to turn up my music for a little bit.2. FitOverall the fit was ok. The instructions to properly insert the earbuds were a bit difficult to adjust to but I got the hang of it eventually as once they are in your ear, you are supposed to twist them down into your ear. The issue with this was that after a period of time, the earbud would untwist on their own requiring you to readjust them. This also happens if you make any kind of face movement aside from talking or eating such as smiling. This might not be a problem except the noise control ability of the earbud is completely dependent on the seal it has on your ear. This is easily disrupted when it moves out of place. Aside from that, the earbuds did not fall out of my ears easily.3. Noise controlOne of the aspects of these earbuds I was excited for was the noise control. According to some reviews, it was just shy of Air pod pro level. Especially since I got it for 120$ less than half the price of airpod pros, I was excited to see their noise control ability. I was again disappointed. As mentioned above, the seal of the earbuds on your ear is easily broken therefore making noise control pretty much useless. Aside from that, it does a pretty decent job at blocking out VOICES when there is music playing at a medium volume. BUT it does NOT block out low frequency sounds well such as that of a car engine.4. Appearance/caseThese earbuds look decent enough, if you dislike having stems like from air pods you will like these. They are pretty discrete but not as discrete as the beats fit pro. The ends of the earbuds still come out a little bit of your ears. The case is slightly larger than that of the air pods pros and slightly thicker. It has a matte  finish as opposed to the glossy finish of the air pods. I actually prefer the matte finish but that is my preference. One gripe I have is the fact that you are provided with a charger but it is usb-c to usb-c as well as being about 2 inches in length. Aside from the ridiculously short length, not having a cable have a usb side is extremely annoying.Summary:If you can get these earbuds for a discounted price, they are an absolute steal, for being only very slightly more expensive than regular airpods, they are a big step up. For 150$ I really don't think they are worth it. I decided to return mine and pay the extra 50$ for the Beat fit pros.",3.0 out of 5 stars

When they don't cut out and actually charge, they are decent sound wise but yeah.... if you are looking to connect them to a computer, it's probably not a good idea.

In the end though, I would have rather paid more for this product and have it include the H1 chip. To be clear, it does integrate better than any old set of bluetooth headphones, but nowhere nearly as good as AirPods(or even devices like the beats flex which use the older W1 chip).Sound quality, which is probably most people's biggest concern, is good. Better than AirPods Pro in my opinion, not by a mile or anything but I prefer the sound of these over AirPods Pro. These are clearly better sounding than the regular, 2nd generation AirPods from 2019. They do sound a little more bass-y than Apple's normal sound, but it's not the older signature of beats where they used to use too much bass.The active noise cancellation features are halfway there, the ANC is almost as good as AirPods Pro. The problem is the ambient mode where it lets in sounds from the outside. This is one of the worst implementations I have ever heard. I don't know how Apple could do so well with this feature on their own headphones and do so poorly on the Studio Buds, but they did. I basically have to take them out if I need to listen to someone talking to me or be aware of my surroundings. No two ways about it, this feature is terrible. I think it's because there are no vents like AirPods have, and they just weren't able to replicate the sound using only the microphones. I think it probably also is due to the Mediatek chip (MT2821-A) that this product is using, their bluetooth chips probably aren't on the same level as Apple or Qualcomm (you would think they would have used Qualcomm over Mediatek).The AirPods like features of these headphones are sometimes almost as good as the H1, other times, the only way you can get the little popup card on screen is if you hold down the pairing button in the case. Switching between devices is not seamless at all, even ones that you have previously connected to. I oftentimes found myself having to select ""forget device"" in the bluetooth settings and then re pair these earbuds. The only thing they are really good at is using them with just one smartphone or tablet and not trying to jump back and forth between devices. They work pretty much like AirPods if you were just using them with your iPhone and nothing else.Pros+Good sound qualityCancels out a decent amount of the ambient noise using ANCGood value for what you getBuild quality is good for $150 (especially when they are on sale)Cons-No automatic play/pause detectionThe transparency mode is just not good, like AT ALLEven for the features that are supposed to work well, the lack of an H1 chip is a huge bummer for Apple usersNo wireless charging on the caseSwitching between devices, even manually, is a frustrating process that doesn't work as it should",3.0 out of 5 stars
3__Cats,"I like these for listening to music and audiobooks, but they’re terrible for phone calls. I’ve tried to use these for calls, but if there’s any background noise the other person can’t hear me over the background. Ex. road noise or at the grocery store. If I’m in my house or car with silence in the background it’s not a problem, but if there’s any noise I can’t use them. It doesn’t matter what the sound setting is on the ear buds either. Very frustrating.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Bhold,I am very disappointed with the max volume output of these headphones.  For $150 I had much higher expectations but I will likely be returning these because it’s too annoying to have them on maximum volume and feel like that’s probably only 70% of my other headphones volume.  When I have my beats headphones on 50% it is extremely quiet… the difference from 50% up to 100% seems like it only get maybe 15% louder.Not worth the price.,3.0 out of 5 stars
The Gamer King,These headphones are okay and for the price they not worth the price tag. There cheaply made. The sound is mid. After couple uses I notice that the seal near the b in the ear buds are breaking. ANC is terribleIt works well with iOS devices the buds sound the best on Apple Music. The colors that it comes in are nice shades. I these headphones are best bought on sale below the 99 dollar sale mark.,3.0 out of 5 stars
Jamie,"My AirPods started acting up and were just outside the window for the recall. I bought these on sale and thought they would be a good substitute since Apple owns them now. When they actually connect, they are pretty good. But I have to reconnect them to Bluetooth several times a day. They are not nearly as user friendly as AirPods so I’m retuning them. If you have have had AirPods for a long time, these are quite the adjustment and the annoyance of having to reconnect constantly is not worth the savings to me.Music quality was fine but I’m not super picky or knowledgeable about the nuances of music quality. They sound fine. The noise cancelling feature is good. The case is so rounded that I dropped it a lot and had to buy a bulky case to give it some texture.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Derek,"Me personally didn't like them and returned them. I like the option when there in ur ear. U can turn off the noise cancelation! That's really cool.

They are very comfortable and I have almost no ear pain from them, just wish they lasted longer.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Simcha Weissman,"I ordered these as a replacement for AirPod pros, hoping to save some money. Overall, the product was solid, with a comfortable fit and good sound quality. I did run into two issues. First, when putting the ear bud in, it is wry hard to avoid pressing the pause/play button. Not a fatal flaw, but still a minor inconvenience nonetheless.The second, more glaring issue was the performance of the active noise cancelling. I went for a jog using them, but the sound of my steps were greatly amplified by the ANC system, and it was as enough that I had to shut the ANC off.Ultimately I decided to return these because of the issues with the noise canceling, but they are nonetheless a solid option for people who do not intend to use them while working out.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Fan Lady,"The charge on my AirPods Pro Buds doesn't last the entirety of my long-haul flights or overnight if I wear them to sleep. Buying a 2nd set of AirPods to always have a charged pair on hand seemed excessively expensive and indulgent. These Beats Studio Buds do the trick for less than 1/3 the price of my AirPods. For my purposes, the Beats Studio Buds work out great.The sound quality and noise-cancelation features of the Beats Studio Buds are just a step down from my noise-canceling AirPods Pro Buds. With the Beats Studio Buds, I hear a little more of what's happening around me which is disappointing, hence the 3 stars. However, I wouldn't give the AirPods Pro noise canceling feature more than 4 stars. Neither brand of Buds holds a candle to my Beats over-the-ear noise-canceling headphones. For sound quality, I get some weird feedback if I'm laying down and the Beats Buds rub against my pillow, whereas I've never had that problem with the AirPods Pro, hence 4 stars for Beats Buds vs. the 5 stars I would give to the AirPods Pro. The battery life is almost identical for both brands, which IMO is subpar in both brands of Buds, so I would give them both 3s. I would rather have slightly larger buds that held a charge longer than the tiny buds I'm constantly searching for when I drop them on the floor or into various crevices.The charge on both brands of Buds lasts about the same amount of time, which equates to about 4-5 hours of usage per set. For my very long-haul flights of 10-15 hours plus airport time, my Airpods are recharged again by the time my Beats run dry, and then my Beats are recharged if the 2nd Airpods charge gives up. Most planes have USB ports, but I have yet to find one that does more than trickle charge, which means my iPhone must get the USB port so it doesn't die when I'm watching shows, listening to music and podcasts, or reading on my Kindle app. So I can't recharge my Buds of either flavor while I'm using my phone. Fortunately, the charged-up cases get one set of buds back in action by the time the other set dies, and I can often get enough of a 2nd recharge on my Airpods to last until I reach a 'real' recharging location.",3.0 out of 5 stars
J - RobiMunoz,The quality is great!  The sound quality is great!  The Beats come with several different sizes for input into the ear …. they all are too large for my ears.  If I want to keep them inputted I have to cover my ear to help hold the buds in place.  When I do the previous to keep them in my ear that starts to hurt my ears.,3.0 out of 5 stars
Emily W,"Let me state from the outset that I have not had these ear buds long, but I have no complaints about the sound quality.  I am undecided whether to return these ear buds, because they won't stay in my ears.  I am continually searching the floor for one of the buds.  I have a pair of wired ear buds from Apple that came included with a product at no extra cost, and when one of these buds falls out, it falls into my lap attached by a wire to either the sound source or to my other ear.  Perhaps my ears are not designed for ear buds.  If you have trouble in general with other ear buds falling out, you're likely to have the same trouble with these.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Shannon,Sound is great was really quiet when all the way up but when you put both in you can hear fine even tho it isn’t loud.

Isn’t worth the money I spent tbh,3.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon User,"PROS:1. AMAZING sound quality. Once I farted in the office. I was thinking it was a little harmless quiet fart but people around me heard it. They looked at me and were laughing. The amazing sound quality of this product was to blame and also that burito bowl.2. I like the red color, the design is cute and luxurious. I also can easily find them with the red color.3. Connectivity is more than I expected. Unlike my old earbuds, this don't have connectivity problem. Once you pair it with your phone, it stays paired. You don't have to do it manually from the Bluetooth settings.CONS:1. Expensive. My last earbud was a pair of JBL headphones, it offered almost similar qualities with 60% less price. But that headphone sound quality and connectivity was terrible.2. Noise cancelation sucks. I always get complaints when i'm outside and talking to phone. People on the other side of the line can't hear me.3. battery life is only like 16 to 18 hours.4. After a 20' distance, you loose Bluetooth connectionMixed feeling:I like it that it's small and seamless, however it will hurt your ear lobes and even inner ears if you has small ears. I still struggle with this. But I like how it's in my ears without even the feel of bulky headphones.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Halle,"These earbuds have great sound quality, but the fit and design are not the best. It’s not a touch to pause/play feature, it’s a literal button. Any effort to adjust your earbuds results in whatever you’re listening to to pause. Also, if you pause and then take out the earbuds, often times you’ll bump the button again and it will start playing without your knowledge. If you put them back in the case, it will pause again, but if not then it will continue to play until you notice it.Also, the earbuds become loose and nearly fall out if I am chewing or if I am sweaty.Nice earbuds though, just wish the design was a bit better. I bought these to replace my apple AirPod pro 2’s. The sound quality was much better, but the features did not work as good.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Kassaundra,The sound is very good but the ear buds even though I had in the smallest ear silicone for the buds if I chewed they feel out if but in a tight fit they still kept falling out I do not want to risk the chance of loosing one or both of them,3.0 out of 5 stars
FoxMike,"So let me start by saying the build quality of these in ears and their case are top of the line. They feel and look very high quality. The tactile feel of the buttons are perfect. The position of the buttons did not, however, work for me. This is not a critical comment but merely a statement of fact about what I needed. I often wear my in ears when I am sleeping and I am a side sleeper. When your head presses on the pillow it activates the buttons leaving you with either full volume or no volume(if that is how you set up your button functionality). Again, not a negative comment, just a limitation for how I use mine. Now, to why I only gave them two stars for sound quality. Some background. I own a pair of over the ear Sony WH-100XM3 over the ear headphones. I also own an old set of Skullcandy Method in ears and Raycon Everydays. These are what I judge these Beats against. First of all, nothing comes close to the sound quality of the Sonys. They are a phenomenal set of headphones with a very robust supporting app and I recognize that and take it into account when looking for new in ears. When I first received the Beats I downloaded the app and updated the firmware so everything was up to date. When I played them they were very flat in bass response. Almost tinny if that makes sense. As I dug into the app I noticed they were in noise cancelling mode so I turned that off. Marginally better bass response. So I dug around in the app to try and find an equalizer to adjust. Nothing...So I went into Apple Music and attempted to adjust the equalizer and didn't have much success making the sound better. I was so disappointed I went out and bought a pair of Skullcandy Indy Evos to see if I could get better sound out of a set of in ears half the price....and I did. They were much better sounding. Nothing approaching the Sonys but much better than the Beats. The reason I bought these was to replace my Raycons that I dropped on our wood floor making them sound like they had blown speakers(guess I jarred something loose inside the buds.) I loved the Raycons but that was the second issue I had with a set of Everydays so I won't buy the brand again. I'm too hard on them. With that said, I believe if I would have dropped these Beats I don't think it would have affected them at all. The build quality is very good. They feel incredibly solid and the case feels the same. Unfortunately their sound quality just isn't what I(and I stress the I here. Many people have given these high ratings) would expect from a $120 set of in ears. I hope this helps someone. Again, these Beats have received high ratings so maybe I am just the outlier. Good luck.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Onyx B.,"This product has a lot of problems. I was looking for a good pair of earbuds that also had noise cancelation. What I got was definitely a mixed bag. The first complaint I have is that the earbud sizes are much too large. I know that might not be the case for some people, but I just can't imagine them fitting anyone as all three sizes provided are large, with each larger than the next. This became even more of a problem when the noise cancelation just stopped working. There doesn't seem to be a difference between transparency mode and turning the modes off, and since the noise cancelation doesn't work anymore, I have modes turned off. That really devalues the app itself. The noise cancelation worked great when it did work, even with the earbuds themselves not completely fitting. I got these on sale around Christmas time 2022 and that is one of three things that keeps this review from being two stars.  The second thing is that the sound is good. It would be even better if there had been some smaller sizes available. The third thing is that the battery life is exceptionally good. The product is still useful, albeit at a diminished capacity, so I feel like this product should be in-between two and a half stars and three, but that's not possible. I've bought a lot of cheap earbuds and it's sad to say that their features lasted longer than these. Except Raycons. These are still better than Raycons.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Rej,"This was my first experience with anything ""Beats"" related. As such, I think I had an elevated expectation of what they should have been, which may have played a factor in my expectations, be it unrealistic or not.The look is outstanding. Love the colors, love the concept of the ""twist"" into the ear canal, love the ACTUAL button click to perform functions vs. a touch sensitive ""tap"" that goes haywire with all the other brands.Sound quality was decent, though I wish I had more control over the equalizer, as the presets were way off.What I was hoping they'd be was a better performing ANC earbud. Despite the different sized earbud tips, I never could find one that just ""fit"" how it seemed they should. Using them in the gym, I felt like I had to crank up the volume just to drown out even the background music (which isn't terribly loud). If you had to guess what mode it was in, there really wasn't much difference between the ANC/transparent modes. Also, if there were anything close to my left earbud, I'd get all sorts of feedback noises- presumably it was messing with the microphone or ANC intake.Again- if it were just on the basis of a decent earbud, I think it'd be ok, just not ok for something with the Beats name, or in the $100 range. I can get that kind of quality out of the knock off $30 models here.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I really wanted the same quality of the over ear beats but it’s hard to replicate into a bud. I think the quality is nice on these but not quite the same. Additionally, the buds themselves are pretty uncomfortable and even though i tried various sizes for the tips none of them could keep the buds in my ear for longer than 30-45 mins. The noise cancellation is really great and I love that you can seamlessly connect to apple products. I also really love the color options, which is what led me to switching in the first place but after a few weeks of using the buds I couldn’t stand how they stick out when you wear them, how sensitive the controls are on each bud and how they slowly push out of your ears after extended use.

Alexandre,"Just got ‘em. And several hours later… here’s my honest opinion. I’m totally satisfied with the design, size, fit, iPhone compatibility, charging case, price, range, etc. Can’t tell you much about their battery life yet. What I do wanna tell you about is the sound. I’ve tried a lot! of high-end headphones and earbuds over the years. Bose, Sennheiser, Sony, Apple, JBL… But these Beats Studio Buds blew my mind! Clarity within strong bass. True sound of live music. Unbelievable! You MUST check this out. Go to YouTube and search for “dolby atmos sound test”. Believe you me, it’s a game changer! These bad boys CAN pull it off, revealing their full potential! Amazing! PS usb-c to usb-c charging cable (included) is an idiotic idea! IMHO, usb-c to usb cord would be more suitable.Update: Two weeks later. Here's a few things I'm not happy about...Battery life. Honestly, I don’t think they can last up to 8 hrs. straight, as Beats claims (without putting ‘em occasionally into the charging case). Wearing ‘em “on and off”, the battery charge level drops rapidly within a couple of hours. (neither ANC nor Transparency mode activated) Hmm…Physical “click buttons” suck! Sticking ‘em into my ears (with my sausage fingers) can be quite challenging sometimes. I happen to press these buttons too many times and this is annoying as hell! Oh, well…Lack of volume control!!! That’s a big issue, I’ve experienced with New Beats Studio Buds, for sure! Every now and then, you may wanna adjust the volume… Nope, can’t do it! You must have your phone nearby.An instant pairing with iPhone works 6-7 times out of 10. Go figure, right!?In conclusion, I have to say I still like Beats. I’m gonna keep ‘em as a secondary pair. The sound is astonishing, no doubt about that! The price is right too. Would I recommend ‘em? I guess. But… (read above)",3.0 out of 5 stars

Cee Sal,"while they do solve the problem of somewhat being inconspicuous especially at work where i'm not allowed to have airpods in, they dont stay in unless u shove them in deeply and eventually wedge themselves out. so far i have dropped them in a parking lot (black against asphalt is hell to look for them) they're way too bouncy. and they dropped in the ladies room and bounced 2 stalls away. the sound quality is not good. as you're adjusting them to not slip out of your ear, the music stops. and the double tap to advance to the next song works inconsistently or not at all.

Shantiel,"I wish I had a review like this when I was searching so lets get into this. I got this on sale for $100, a steal right? I've been an airpod user for the past 3 years so I was nervous looking around for reviews. For reference, I have an iPhone 12 pro.Cons1- The case is MASSIVE. In comparison to the Airpod case. They both come with cases that are able to charge.2- Missing H1 Chip. What does that actually mean? No Live Listen. No text announcements.3- The bud. The ear bud in theory seems like a great idea. I was excited to have a button. The placement of the button its self.. was not well thought out. I've hung up on plenty of calls trying to readjust the bud.4- Speaking of the adjustment. None of the tips have really made a ""firm fit"" So they do slip and slide.5- No in ear detection. Won't pause music automatically.Pros1- Noise cancellation is really good. I can't hear any outside noise when it's active.2- Microphone works the same - Everyone hears me crystal clear.3- The seamlessness from case to ear is amazing.4- The Magnet is VERY strong. If I drop my airpod cause my airpods fall out. Not these. They stay snug in their place.5- Even without in ear detection. I don't mind pausing my music in it's place.All around, the beats are a very different experience than the airpods. If I had a review that placed it as plainly as this I don't think I would have gotten these beats. I'm keen to my apple products due to the seamless capabilities. I did think that as beats are now produced by Apple, that alot of these cons would not have been an issue. But unfortunately they are, I'll try them for a little longer and see if my opinion changes otherwise I'll be right back to being an airpod user.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Brandon,"UPDATE: 9/15/21 So, now I can safely say that these are probably the worst designed buds they have ever released. For the first week I assumed that my small ear canals were the reason they were not staying in my ears. However, even after purchasing aftermarket tips that were smaller than the ones provided, they are still pushing out of my ears especially when I am sweating in the gym. I even had a few friends try them on with the same result so it isn't just me. Also, I just received a replacement pair because the 1st pair decided that the right bud was gong to start cracking and popping suddenly (not even a week into owning them). And honestly, I shouldn't have even replaced them because now I am returning two pairs since they just aren't worth it without some type of hook to keep them in your ear. I'd say either invest in the previous model or a different brand, even though I love Beats and have always gotten their headphones I wouldn't recommend these to anyone.I have just received these this morning 9/10/21. My first impressions are that they are way more compact and portable compared to the previous Power Beats which are my favorite headphones of all time. They also currently do not present any connectivity issues like the previous models did on my X Max. I heard many people complaining about how slippery the case is but I have to say the matte black color wave don't just slip out of my hand easily. The active noise canceling is pretty good definitely hard to compare with over ear beats products but I digress.  Now to my dislikes, currently I am running these without any of the 3 provided tips because none of them will allow them to stay in my ears without shifting or coming out. I also tried the tips from my previous Power Beats to no resolve. So, I just purchased some aftermarket tips that I am hoping will resolve my issue. However, if they don't I think I will be inclined to just return them because I really only purchased these as a birthday gift to myself and if they can't stay in my ears than I am happy with sticking with the previous Power Beats Model. I will update my review once the other tips arrive on Monday, hope this helps.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Kenrick,"These are extremely easy to lose, especially if you're active. They slip out of your ear very easily. Good sound, but mic quality isn't the best.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Steven Tanner,"The sound quality of these things amazed me and thats obviously not why I gave it a low rating.I find these headphones really uncomfortable no matter which size pad I used and they would often just flop out of my ears, and as someone who likes to listen to music while I work its not great especially cause it would be easy to lose these expensive-ish headphones if they fell off. I was looking for something to replace my gen 1 airpods (they still work they’re just old) but the airpods definitely are staying because of this and the next point.Having a physical button instead of touch based controls is increasingly annoying especially when on a phone call because it only takes one accidental push to end the call.Out of they box they came with and almost full charge which was really nice but after using them for a few days at work it felt like they barely held a charge and I could easily use the earpiece battery and the case battery through a whole day without charging it.Also the noise cancellation is a great setting and idea, but there’s no signifier letting you know if its on or off. Maybe there should be like an audio signal that says it? It made a noise when changing mode but its the same when you turn it on and off, its really hard to tell when you only use one earbud.Other than that I have a few picky things like the case being pretty massive, and the fact that it needs a usb c cable to charge and it didn’t even come with one and I didn’t see anything about it needing one when I ordered it, luckily I had one from a magnetic charger I bought.I’ve already returned this item and got my money back but man I do miss the sound quality of these things but its not worth the above mentions. I’m still using my gen 1 airpods because they have no issues other than they don’t have sound cancellation and that the sound quality just isn’t exactly on par but its not too big of a difference",3.0 out of 5 stars
Sean R. Wolnick,these do work alright nothing to special about these and quite honestly for this price you can do better. the noise cancelling for these isnt good. sometimes the white noise they use will over power the audio that your trying to listen to and  so i often have to turn off the noise cancelling mode. another observation that ive found is that the noise cancelling will turn on automatically some times.,3.0 out of 5 stars
Melissa mata,I love the size color. Good quality easy to use. Too bad that the performance is not that great. Call.,3.0 out of 5 stars
SJ Holley,"Glad I got these when they were on sale. I'd heard great things about Beats and decided to give them a try. First the pros: They are compact enough to carry. They do well when I use them with my iPhone. They provide good sound when I listen to music. Not sure they provide any better or worse sound than other buds I own, so I can't say they are outstanding in that respect.Cons: This suckers keep falling out of ear. I'm using the smallest size, but still have had these work out of both ears. I'm not thrilled with the battery life. 8 hours? No way! If I listen to music they really suck the juice. I see that you have to really jump through tech hoops to get the 8 hours, but who does that? I can't even get 6 hours out of mine, so I'd be prone to cut all their alleged times in half.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Brandon,"First let me say that these are the third pair of wireless earbuds I've purchased (The other two being One Plus Buds, and a pair by Sony at a similar price point). As far as audio quality goes, these are definitely some of the best, if not the best, pair of headphones I've used. If that were the only factor, they'd definitely get five stars.There are two main problems with these that bring that rating down. The first is battery life. Out of all the wireless earbuds I've owned, these definitely have the worst battery life. Not to say they die quickly, but they just don't last as long as the other two pairs I've had. If it weren't for the second issue, I'd still probably give them five stars in spite of the battery life.The second problem is issues with connectivity. This problem actually IS terrible. I frequently have issues with the buds either not connecting to my phone, or not disconnecting when I put them back into the case. Quite a few times now I've had to manually go into the settings and disconnect the buds to fix it, turning what should've been a few seconds of popping them in into a few minutes of troubleshooting. When the buds work they're great, but this issue is such a headache that I'll definitely be looking for a replacement pair.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Andrew,"Got these at half off to replace my AirPods that stopped working. Overall, these weren’t nearly as good as I was hoping based on the $150 price and relatively good reviews.Pros:They do fit very well and stay in easily. Really comfortable to wear and I haven’t had them fall out while moving around.Battery life is fairly good, definitely outlasts my older 2nd gen AirPodsNoise cancelling is nice, not up to par with over ear headphones but that’s to be expected.Cons:Sound. Out of the box these really lacked bass. Everyone has different preferences here so maybe that’s just me. Figured this would be an easy fix through their equalizer. Nope. The Bose app doesn’t support these earbuds, only the more expensive variants. Pretty unacceptable to have a pair of earbuds at this price range be intentionally hindered this way. And yes, they are sealed correctly.Connectivity. I use these with an iPhone and getting them reconnected is always a pain taking them out of the case. I often have to “forget device” and reconnect.They also stutter regularly (every 5 minutes or so) while no other Bluetooth headsets I’ve used have this problem.The play button is also very easy to press when putting them in, a pretty minor inconvenience compared to the above points.The case is incredibly cheaply made for something in this price range. Not a huge issue, but I could see the lid breaking in the future.Really not impressed with these, I’ll be returning them. Regular AirPods are cheaper and have vastly better sound quality imo.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Anthony Ortega,"Pretty cool at first glance, but as you listen to a podcast, music or watch a video, every couple seconds there will be a gap in the audio as of the earbuds aren't connecting. Device could be right in front of me with no obstructions and still patchy audio. They are slightly less irritating than airpods, i will say that much.",3.0 out of 5 stars
JFran,"They fall out of my ear easily, I barely use them. The ear buds came in a different color than my earbuds which is weird. They are easy to connect and the sound proof is really good and it works. The case is matte and it gets dirty easily you might want to get a case for them.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Keith Porter,Sound was pretty good! I loved the variety of colors….However they didn’t fit in my ears very well. I tried the different tips but one just wouldn’t stay put and kept falling out. I liked that the Bluetooth was similar to apples but I decided to go back to Apple AirPods instead 😅,3.0 out of 5 stars
Jax,"Sound seems decent and so does the noise cancellation. I wouldn’t say it is somehow superior to most earbuds though. I do not love the design of these, the shape makes me feel like they’re constantly going to slip out of my fingers. Also not a great design if you have smaller ears. I was able to use the little silicone inserts from another pair of earbuds I have that are smaller than the ones they came with, but they still feel like they’re going to fall out of my ears. Not sure if it’s a combo of having small ears and the buds feel a little heavier than other earbuds I’ve tried. I’ve been on an earbud journey search lol. I do like that I don’t have to download an app to control the sound, you can go in through your Bluetooth settings from iPhone. It also shows up in your find my iPhone app as well which is nice. It does have active noise cancel, normal and transparency in the settings which is what I’ve returned other ear buds because they said they had ANC but actually didn’t - it was automated and crappy.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Vladimir Danishevsky,I bought it on April 18. Today Sep 17 right unit stoped functioning. I expect much longer life span than 6 months.Problem was fixed when I did complete reset.

HarryFord,"The sound quality is great; very clear with no vibrations.  Switching from AirPods there are 2 main areas where the Beats Studio Buds could be improved.  Noise cancellation is foremost.  When I flew with my AirPods, the moment I put them in the engine noise and other ambient noises (kids crying, etc.) was shut out.  With the BSB I had to keep checking to make sure they were set to Noise Cancellation mode because there is no difference when they are in or not.  Same is true when I am listening to my music at the gym.  If the music at the gym is loud, I really have to turn the Beats up.  The second issue is that it took a while to figure out how the buds fit in my ears.  Once in, they are comfortable, but putting them in and taking them out can be a little tricky as they are slippery.  Maybe there should be some sort of ridge on the exterior to make them easier to grab onto.I bought these because they were better priced than the AirPods, but if I had to do it all over again I would switch with the AirPods.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Papa Boots,"Whenever I see something with a 4-star review, it usually means it’s a solid product but there’s something (or somethings) keeping it out of 5-star range.For me, these are a perfect example of that. They’re small (good), not terribly obtrusive (only some out-of-ear-stick-out, tho your experience may vary), the sound has some solid bass which is helpful for the gym (where I tested these out), the sound overall is clear (download some equalizer apps to play with the sound itself), and they stayed in my ear well. I don’t know much about soundstage or whatever, but the sound itself is clear, bass is nice and strong, and you can hear even the subtle nuances like the shifting of a hand on guitar strings clearly enough without being disturbed. That, to me, is the sign of a good earbud.The transparency mode and noise canceling modes were alright. But that’s just it, they’re alright. Granted, the AirPod Pros have a higher price tag, so they do the ANC and Transparency mode much better. So it’s understandable that these would do the same, but on just the slightest bit of a lower level.I’m also spoiled bc the Airpod Pros have wireless charging. These DO have USB C, but the lack of wireless charging is a small thing, really. There’s something about being able to toss these on a charging pad and leaving them there to charge that’s just so satisfying. Also, was not a fan of how the case just doesn’t have that “premium” feel. The matte finish is nice, tho I would have liked a little more weight in the case lid, but at this point, these are such little (and I mean LITTLE) things that really, it’s not a dealbreaker.My only thing is the amount they stick out. I’m sorry, but they do look a little…funny, the way they sort of stick out just a bit so that the “b” logo is upright. They don’t stick out a LOT, but juuuuust enough that when you look in the mirror, you’ll see a vertical line where the physical button (which I have managed to press on accident a couple of times while adjusting the bud) sticks out. Also, I had a little difficulty getting them to stay in, but that’s beyond pretty much anyone’s control.These get that 4th star because of just how they are a solid enough product worth the purchase. They don’t do any one thing particularly well, but there are just enough teeny things for me that I wouldn’t say these are the best I’ve ever used. (For comparison, the Jabra 75t gets the equivalent of a 4.3 rating…the hear-through is amazing and their app really helps boost functionality).For me, these are SOLID gym earbuds. They play music loudly, clearly enough, and the bass is strong enough for me that I can drown out whatever annoying other music is playing outside. They fit and stay relatively well. For the price tag, you get some good bang for the buck. You could do worse, but at this range, depending on if you want to pitch in a few more, you could also do better.",4.0 out of 5 stars
michael ryan,"Overall, these earbuds are very serviceable. They have average sound, pretty good battery life, passive noise canceling, fit is fine, buttons are annoying.Sound: Nothing special here. They get plenty loud. Sound is pretty clear for this class of earbud.Battery life: I use earbuds a lot and only had to charge the case every 2 or three days.ANC: There is no active noise canceling. Not that works in any meaningful way at least. Compared to my Sony WF-1000XM4's(which I highly recommend) there is no ANC.Fit: They don't hurt, they fall out fairly easily, go in in an odd way.Buttons: You hit them when you don't want to(A LOT), not capacitive,Overall, pretty good earbud for the price.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Rhonda  Arshad,I got these to down grade from the Apple Air pods and these were good until I got a defected pair. I contacted Amazon to get a refund and they said that I had to have to turn them in after I tossed them in the trash. I spend a lot of money on them so sense they didn’t refund me my money I had them fixed.They work okayThe sound is great if you can find the right size ear buds to fit your ear. And the charge box doesn’t stay charged as long as other earbuds I’ve bought in the past.Over all I got a refurbished pair so they weren’t the best. But since I was able to fix the problem I kept them and they are good for now,4.0 out of 5 stars

Gillian,"Both my boyfriend and I bought these amd , while theyre great, we both agree that they tend to feel like they are falling out of our ears even when they aren’t, which is a bit annoying. The slightest adjustment also affects how “close” the music sounds, which contributes to the loose sensation. Giving 4 stars instead of 3 because they hold a charge really well, connect via Bluetooth easily, and the sound comes through so clear I genuinely thought my phone was playing music by itself the first time I tried them.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Cristina,I have had different types of Beats headphones over the years and these by far are my favorite. The battery life is very long im able to listen to my videos for hours on end.

I’ve had them for a while now and still my favorite headphones I prefer these over Apple AirPods.,4.0 out of 5 stars
magc,"Pros: Sound quality and battery durability.Cons: it’s odd for phone calls, the mic is good but as there is no return of your voice I didn’t get use to it - it seems like when you speak it applies the noise cancellation to your own voice so you don’t get any natural return as you would in a real conversation or a hands free call - it’s odd. Not sure if there is a way to configure this without disabling the noise cancelation for external noise.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Daiquiria,"I love these earbuds! The sound quality is beautifully balanced and crisp. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because they will not stay in my ears.

I have small ear holes though, but other than that everything else was wonderful!",4.0 out of 5 stars
billrafferty,"Like my last couple of pairs of Beats these sound really good. My hearing isn’t the greatest but they give decent bass, good mids and highs. The pairing is super simple with iOS and pairing with one device (my iPhone) automatically paired them with my other device (my iPad). The left earbud doesn’t quite sit as snugly as the right one but that’s likely my own ear shape than an indictment of the device itself. I’ll keep going back to Beats products because overall I like them.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Ryan Reynolds,"I've had these earphones for close to a year now and love the listening experience on them. They provide nice, clean, punchy bass that's perfect for listening to rap and other bass heavy music. The increased bass may not be ideal those who prefer a more balanced audio profile, but it's perfect for my needs. They also work really well for gaming I've found. The pairing process is really fast and easy as well. I've run into a few times where they don't want to pair with my phone when I take them out the case, but putting them into pairing mode usually fixes this issue.The top lid feels a bit flimsy and has some give to it from side to side which doesn't inspire trust in the long term viability of the hinge, but only time can tell. The noise cancellation is good on them and gives the feeling of being in a bubble at full volume, but isn't any better compared to other noise cancelling earphones on the market for a similar price point. The transparency mode isy only real issue with these as there's a slightly noticable static sound when you use it, but after about a year of use I've pretty much gotten used to it to the point that I don't even notice it. Sounds around you still sound a bit muffled as compared to not having them in while in transparency mode as well.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Three major problems I have with them is one, they don’t stay in my ear, basically they fall out unless I’m keeping still. I’ve watched enough videos to know that it’s in correctly I shouldn’t have to constantly fix it in my ear every time I feel it inch away from it. Can you imagine the fear I have walking.Secondly, it does not automatically connect when I put them in my ears (sometimes but mostly not all the time). Even when I manually try to connect through Bluetooth it’s saying unsuccessful connection make sure the device is in range. Like I could literally have the buds sitting on top of my phone and nothing (and of course I make sure it’s charged.)Lastly, not a major issue but could be a possibility from time to time whenever I close the case it makes this screeching sound and even when it’s closed it sometimes continues making that sound.

BeanBandit,"Out of all the wireless earbuds I’ve used, these have got to be my favorite sound quality wise. The most expensive wireless buds I’ve purchased were the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 and boy they were terrible. It was when I bought the Beats Studio Buds that I realized that the Buds 2’s sound quality was truly terrible. These beats buds are just very good. Most buds (in order to give the illusion that they’re good quality) typically increase the bass but then the rest of the music sounds terrible. But with these, the bass is increased but the rest of the sound isn’t compromised and is very clear. Very good quality buds. I’m not giving these a 5 stars tho however since there are some issues that I wish would be fixed.1.) This is very minor, but the earbuds don’t pause the audio once they’re taken out like other earbuds I’ve used (i.e. the Samsung Galaxy Buds 1 and 2). Not a huge problem but sucks having to replay a moment of a song I just missed because I had to take my earbuds out for a sec.2.) Another small thing, but the audio stops completely when you put in one of the buds which is just a little inconvenience.3.) This isn’t such a small problem like the last two complaints. Sometimes when I put both buds in the case, one of them doesn’t tend to charge and so then my phone recognizes that the earbuds are out of the case and so then my audio from my phone comes out from the earbud that’s supposed to be charging and disconnected from my phone. This is problematic because sometimes I’ll be trying to use my buds just for one of them to be at 5% since it just wasn’t charging in the case so then I have to wait for it to charge, which isn’t a long time but it’s still very annoying.4.) The transparency mode kind of sucks. Whilst the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2’s overall audio sucked, it’s transparency mode was much louder which meant I didn’t have to turn down my earbuds just talk still hear whoevers talking to me like I have to do with the Beats Studio Buds. You can barely hear any outside noises with the transparency mode on if the Buds’ volume is somewhere around 50%. The noise cancelling mode is pretty good though.5.) Finally, the mic doesn’t work that well. From my experience of calling people with the buds on, whilst the sound quality is pretty good compared to other buds, you have to talk kind of loud as the buds don’t pick up much sound. I typically just disconnect my buds when I’m answering a call and just use my phone’s mic because it’s much more convenient than having to yell-talk to my buds just for people to hear me.Overall these are good buds, especially for 90 bucks (which is what they were when I bought them on sale). If you’re looking for something that’s fairly cheap but still has good quality, then these are the buds for you.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Timothy R.,"These are amazing. They are comfortable, but after trying all size tips for the buds they still will not stay in my ear. I work in the aerospace field so when they fall out they gets covered in steel with the magnets. The noise canceling and transparency setting are great for at work listening to music or talking on the phone. They r the loudest buds I've used so far and these being my 4th pair but first from this company. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is cause of your listening to music almost non stop, I have yet to get more than 3½ hours of straight play B4 they die. It does say I'm suppose to get 8 hours but maybe if they r not used at all they will last that long. I only use the left or the right at a time so it's not that much of a problem. Case stays charged all day but in a 10 hour work day, bother left and right will have to be charged 2x's to get me threw the day. After a couple weeks of having them now I can say I get a good 3 hours MAX with a full charge per bud.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Richard McCune,"The items came as described. The packaging was a nice little touch.Being a Beats/Apple product you would think the battery life would be a little longer. I can only get about 4hrs out of them while listening at just below half volume. Why do I listen to things at about half volume? Because the noise canceling isn’t that great. I can still hear every word someone is saying two isles away at the gate area while sitting and waiting to board an airplane.Fortunately these are not my primary noise canceling earbuds for studying or doing research for work….if they were I would return them. I guess I expected more out of a Beats/Apple product….man I sound like a audio snob. Well, I just want 100% quality products for my money.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Linda Lincoln,"The Beats Studio Buds are true wireless earbuds that deliver an immersive audio experience coupled with noise-canceling technology. Designed for compatibility with both Apple and Android devices, these earbuds offer convenience, superior sound quality, and a sleek design.One of the standout features of the Beats Studio Buds is their impressive sound performance. The earbuds deliver clear, dynamic, and well-balanced audio across a range of genres. The bass response is particularly noteworthy, providing a punchy and deep low-end without overpowering the other frequencies. Whether you're listening to music, podcasts, or watching videos, the Studio Buds create an enjoyable and immersive soundstage.The active noise-canceling technology in these earbuds effectively blocks out external sounds, allowing you to focus on your audio without distractions. Whether you're in a noisy environment or seeking some tranquility, the noise cancellation feature helps create a more immersive and enjoyable listening experience. The transparency mode also comes in handy when you need to be aware of your surroundings without removing the earbuds. While the Beats Studio Buds offer numerous advantages, there are a few minor considerations to keep in mind. Some users have reported that the touch controls on the earbuds can be a bit sensitive, leading to accidental commands. Additionally, the lack of wireless charging for the case may be a downside for those looking for ultimate convenience.In conclusion, the Beats Studio Buds are impressive true wireless earbuds that offer a superior audio experience with noise cancellation capabilities. The sound quality, comfortable fit, seamless connectivity, and convenient features make them a solid choice for music lovers and audio enthusiasts. Whether you're an Apple or Android user, these earbuds provide an immersive and enjoyable listening experience on the go.",4.0 out of 5 stars
bPm,"O.K. I never thought I'd own a pair of beats earbuds, bud I do. And I have to stay, they're not bad. There's a (alright, there's a few) caveats, but not enough for me to return them. The build is the typically spun hardened plastic, of a oddly shaped buds that interestingly fit near perfectly. The buds are tiny, compared to many other brands. As mentioned they're oddly shaped, by two (also an oval shaped flat surfaced which is used to control the buds) angular sides and a round ball in front, where the canal protrudes that you attach your tips. The fit isn't bad, and once sealed it doesn't move around, or fall out whilst doing certain activities. I use XL sized silicone tips. I find they work best for me, for almost every bud I've owned or tested over the years.If the fit is too short, you can always use double, or even triple flange tips. Which I use on occasion. Depends on the buds I'm fitting in question. That extra length can help get the seal you need for the most optimal sound reproduction.  Throughout this year I have tried a plethora of buds. From Sony's XM3, to Audio Technica CKS5TW And Nuarl (I plan to get them again, when funds permit) N6Pro's , which I actually (they have a really good sound, rich luscious bass, sweet and engaging mids, and to top it off, a sparkling treble, not over the top, mind you) liked, but the buttons were a little finicky. As to why I returned them.The biggest, most prevalent issue I came across was that most of them didn't fit properly, at all. I could barely get the XM3's in, and keep them in. As with Shures Aionic, another I liked and wanted desperatelythem to work out. Because they sounded great. The Studio buds are not a problem. It takes me seconds to insert and position them in my ears. The only (again, there's more than one) detraction I have, is that the  buds are easy activate whilst attempting to insert them into your ears. For me it's not a deal breaker. Oh, I almost forgot an important issue. And that is with the battery life. They average a minimum three plus hours. Which is not that long. Then again, who spends more than three hours listening to stuff ? Well, I do. These are for nighttime use mostly. I use them when my roomy has gone to bed. So I need to get an average fours plus. One night I got close to 5 hours. Guess it depends on usage.  What else can I say, other to try for yourself. . At the least, you can return them if you're not happy, right. I'm using them now, as I do at nights.I'm going to buy the Philips Fidelio T1's. I bought and had to return for a replacement. But the delivery person did not deliver them, when they came. Why, I don't.. But I became infuriated and cancelled the order. to buy at a later date. I loved the sound. They have a hybrid configuration of a DD and a BA. For those who don't know the abbreviations, it's dynamic driver, and balanced amature drivers. That's , cause sound is impressive. And the price on them now, is 155$ A drop of a 100$ A good deal to me, for a worthy set of buds. all I'm gonna say for now. But I am going to acquire them I'll be editing removing any errors. But for now, enjoy. Hope it can help you decide",4.0 out of 5 stars
Evelin,I have the airpods (pro gen 2) but i temporarily lost them in my own home. I was freaking out because my warranty expired (to get new ones) - so I gave up on searching for my airpods and decided to buy a new pair but they pricey… so i went on tik tok and boom. I bought these. (However i got them used because i needed them til i found my airpods.) Came with a charger and the soft tips/covers of 2 or 3 diff sizes. All packaged up. Looked brand new tbh. I did clean them just in case. I will say though that it felt weird getting use to these beats. I struggled to put them on correctly because they would fall out easily but tbh you just have to twist a tini bit to adjust them and they stay on. I found my airpods A MONTH LATER but whenever i go out on a trip i bring them incase my airpods are low on battery. (Beats battery life is Excellent. I legit didnt charge them for 2 days and used it for a weirdly extended amount of time (All day basically) and they died on day 3 but i would say the battery life is good.) They do sound good too. If your on a phone call though and you adjust one of the buds. It hangs up but i think you can customize that on settings if you go to bluetooth. These beats caught my attention because it says it has noise/ transparency mode. 8 1/2 out of 10. For the mode. I let my cousin try them and he liked them a lot. He has android and i have an iphone. No issue connecting to either devices. Thank you for reading.,4.0 out of 5 stars

Mendoza,"Very comfortable in the ear, and they sound fine on my end.They seem to connect easily with my phone. My only issues are reported to me by people I talk to. Several times in a conversation I'm told that I'm cutting out or breaking up. Eventually I'll pop out whichever bud I'm using and pop in the other one. Then they'll say, ""that's better,"" but after some time I hear complaints about them cutting out again.Another small complaint is it's too easy to accidently press the button and hang up when I'm just trying to adjust them. Maybe that's on me, though.Still going to use them, at least for now, but I feel there are more reliable earbuds.On the plus side, they are quick to recharge, the case looks good, and as I said before, they are comfortable.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Jeran,"Picked these up to replace the Echo Buds I had used for about a year. I use these as earplugs and the noise cancellation on the Echo buds was... not good, let's say. The Beats certainly do a lot better, the battery will easily last me most of the day if I leave them on passive, but I just wish that seated a little bit deeper into the ear canal.  Years ago I had some anker earbuds that nothing else has matched on pure passive noise blocking and fitment.Still, these are a pretty close second and I got them for half off on a sale. They do what I need them to and they do it well enough until someone's running a rivet gun full bore 8 feet from you.",4.0 out of 5 stars

C. F.,"I got these buds last year (2022). Sound is nice, bass is clear. Battery life is decent. I like that it works well for both Apple and Android users. It also works for my now discontinued ipod nano! Size is just right for my hand. The buds were a little small as they have no stem, but I got used to it eventually. No big deal there actually. Easy to navigate function on the fly by  pressing on the buttons on the earbuds . Calls also sound great!However, nothing is perfect. Having said that, there is some discomfort when I press the physical buttons in  the earbuds. Some staticky sounds when on ambient mode. Also on facebook messenger calls, some staticky sounds are noticed. They could get my ears sore when wearing them for a long time - like 2 hours.But overall they are still a great pair of wireless earbuds. Still would recommend them, I love my Beats earbuds and I’m happy with the purchase.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Prior purchaser,Good sound.  Hard to keep in ears.  Drop calls when they fall out.  They connect to the iPhone easily.  They don't always automatically take the call like AirPods do.  If you answer with the button on the phone you have to flip through to change where sound is coming from.,4.0 out of 5 stars
Scottso,"First, there are a lot to like about these.  They are well made.  As do all Beats they pair easy with iDevices.  The sound is fine, if not spectacular.  Noise cancellation is excellent and there are three levels (full, pass through, none).  The case is compact and fits easy in a front pocket or whereever.  There are also a lot of hard shell and silicon cases available on here and elsewhere.My favorite aspect of these: the form factor of the buds themselves.  These ‘screw’ into your ears for a comfortable and secure seal that doesn’t come out and is inconspicuous.  Easily, they’re the most secure earbuds I’ve ever owned.  And, for phone calls and Zoom conferences where you only need one bud they’re great.  Overall I think they compare, well, to the early iterations of the AirPods.That said, and above all, keep in mind this is basically an entry level product.  The sound is good, but will not blow you away.  Spotify (even at high res) is just OK; Apple Lossless is good but will be better on upgraded buds  The firmware functionality is very limited; you can either control noise cancelling or volume, but you can’t do both.  For some people battery life may not be all that; I find it fine.  How these will hold up in intense workouts I don’t know; but I mowed my lawn with these and they were fine.  Also, for whatever reason I found these cut out every now and then when I was mowing the lawn, but I don’t know why.The four star rating above is based on full price.  I got these for a third off and for that price I’d give these five stars, easy.  And, if you can get these reconditioned, all the better.  But if you’re looking for something that is more powerful, go a level up.UPDATE 8-13-2022:  Affirming my earlier review.  I really enjoy these.  The sound is great, noise cancelling works great, they’re secure.  And they’ve held up.On a few phone calls people have had a hard time hearing me with these but not always and it may have been on their end.  Bottom line: I still say at 149 these are four star, 99 or below five star.Update 2-19:  These are still great.  Very comparable to AirPods.  They don’t fall out, compatible with iPhone and Apple devices.  Again, wait for a sale and/or check out used ones.  Like I said, at $149 these are 4 star, $99 or less five star.",4.0 out of 5 stars
PennyLane,"I’ve had these for the past year or so and they still work perfectly. They fit well and the noise cancelling is awesome. The only reason these didn’t get 5 stars are:- magnet on the case is weak. If you drop these babies, the case will open and at least one of these suckers goes flying.- when switching earbuds to let the one I’ve been using charge, they stop audio and occasionally won’t play when I press the button on the earbud itself.-I’ve had slight pairing issues where I’ve had to open and shut the case multiple times in order for my phone to pair with them. Once they are paired though, they stay paired unless both go back into the case.All in all, for the money you spend I think these are a great option. They’re reliable, sleek, and have decent sound quality. Battery life is good, and they seem to charge pretty fast.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Thomas Carpenter,"Bought these to replace Airpod Pros due to an ongoing problem with noise in the left pod.  Much lower priced than either a repair or replacement of the Airpods.  Turns out these Beats are much better for my use.  I don't listen to music much (news and podcasts), so fidelity isn't an issue with me.  Noise cancellation is superior to the Airpods.  The only thing I miss is the reading of texts and iPhone calling/answering.  Have to use the phone itself.  Connection with Bluetooth was immediate and seamless.  The button to pause and resume audio, and to change noise cancellation is convenient and functions well.  If you're not into blowing out your eardrums with music I can recommend the Studio buds.",4.0 out of 5 stars

C&H,"Very easy to sync up to your smartphone, quality sound, noise cancellation, and nice ear bud case holder design. If you turn your music up at a very high volume the treble and bass becomes a little distorted on certain song types. I like the options of sizes when it comes to the buds - I use the small size and this works best for me. Beware of using these when doing heavy cardio exercise or walking at a fast pace, because they do have the tendency to shift inside the ear canal and possibly fall out. Also, be cautious of where you touch the pods while in your ear because you can either pause your music or hang up when talking to someone on the phone. In my opinion, these are the best alternatives to Airpods for the quality and price, but they the overall features are not Airpod quality.",4.0 out of 5 stars

waetherman,"I'm literally sitting here writing this review while city workers are outside my apartment jackhammering the sidewalk. The noise cancellation doesn't make all that noise go away, but it softens the noise enough to the point that it's tolerable, especially with some music on. The noise cancelling on these buds is better than my other noise cancelling headphones from Soundcore., Granted those aren't the highest end headphones but they are over-the-ear and one might assume they are more noise isolating to begin with. but they're still not as good.ETA: After using these for a week, I don't think I can keep them. First, there are compatibility issues; sometimes when I connect I only get one bud to work and the other is on but silent. The buds don't seem to be able to remember multiple connections well, so to get both buds working I have to go through a re-pairing process. And perhaps most importantly, the button placement has proven really frustrating. These buds don't fit my admittedly-small ear canals very well, which means I often have to adjust them to make sure they're secure. When I do that though, I inadvertently hit the button either. The has resulted in several dropped calls because apparently hitting the button while on a call stops the call and starts whatever music/podcast you had going before. This is just too frustrating for me to deal with, so these buds are going back.That said, there's quite a bit not to like about these buds. First, the case feels cheap and is much larger than something like an Airpods case - almost twice as big as my Airpods 2 case. It does have some extra battery though, which is good. The second thing I'm not fond of is the button. Unlike Airpods, it's actually a physical button and using it requires pressing hard, jamming the bud into your ear more. And trying to out the bud in or adjust it better often triggers the button. Also, the button has limited functionality - basically it can only be used to pause music, activate Siri, or turn noise cancellation on/off. No skip track, volume controls or anything else. Finally, these are not as well integrated into the Apple universe as well as Airpods. For instance, taking them out of my ear doesn't automatically stop the music/podcast. Little things like that make me miss my Airpods, but in the end the noise cancelation makes these buds the better ones for me. At least until the jackhammering stops.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jeffrey K.,"They sound good (especially the bass) and have great noise cancelling...but...they still deserve 4 stars.  My biggest issue is the bluetooth audio lag, called latency.  When I use these to watch youtube or netflix the audio doesn't sync with the lips and drives me nuts.  Apparently Beats are known for bad bluetooth latency.

Cory,"After losing my apple AirPods I was very disheartened to have to spend 300 bucks on another pair. That’s when I went out and searched for something comparable and found these. After using them for several month I have overall positive feelings about them however their is many things the future consumers of this product should know.Pros:To start the price point on these is much more affordable than the airpod pros. The wireless works well and I have not had any range issues with them or issues with them randomly cutting off or disconnecting. The noise cancellation is solid but not perfect. It does it job but it does give me a fish bowl feeling when NC is turned on. The battery life is also amazing. I believe they are rated for 8 hours and I can say I can get around 6 hours out of them before the low power beep comes on.Cons:With the benefit of its low price point, some corners were definitely cut. Let’s start with the spacial audio. It’s not vary clear and when turned on it fails to compare to the air pods pro, where you can literally forget you have headphones in. Secondly the microphone on these is very bad. It sounds like you’re talking through a two way radio. And finally my biggest gripe with these is that in certain situations they emit a very loud high pitched squeal. If I am holding one headphone in my hand, and close my hand, the headphone almost sounds like it has feedback and this isn’t a little it’s loud. Loud enough to hear across the room. I can also recreate this when closing the lid to my case. If I close it to slowly the feedback screech happens almost every time. I worry that this is causing damage to my headphones but I don’t know.Overall I think these are great for the price but have issues and if you have the funds, go buy a pair of galaxy buds or air pod pros.",4.0 out of 5 stars
PC,"I have used Bose Quiet Comfort for decades.  But, they are just too bulky now on airplanes.  I got these Beats Noise Cancelling Ear Buds just for air travel.  I wear hearing aids that stream music and phone calls, so I only need the Beats for air travel.  I take my HA out and put them in the little travel carrying case, and put in the Beats.  See the picture for what I was traveling with and what I am now.I tried another product and it went back the same day, as it kept cutting out and the noise cancelling was not very good. That one had an app I used on my iphone.  Beats arrived today.  Where's the app?  No app.  When I paired it with my iphone, the entry for Beats in the Bluetooth part of the phone's settings automatically updates with all the Beats controls!  However you control your music volume playing on your iphone, that's how you control the volume on Beats.  Tapping the ear bud pauses, forwards, skips the song.So, I tested these against my Bose.  If Bose has a score of 10 for noise cancelling, then Beats is an 8, which is really good I think.  Of course, when you've got music playing then the noise cancelling seems even better, because you are only listening to what you want to listen to.  These will also work great for streaming news videos, movies, and TV programs, while on flights.There is no user manual, but you can find more detailed instructions by just searching online.  If you find yourself pushing and twisting to get them in your ear, switch to the small tips.  Medium is installed, and small and large are included, too.  I had to switch to small to get a snug fit.  The snugger, the better the noise cancelling effect.Sound quality is excellent! I played one of my softer music playlists from my phone to test out the noise cancelling and quality.  Excellent!Final thing:  THERE'S NO USB C WALL ADAPTER INCLUDED for charging, so buy one.  I got one for $10 on Amazon that included a 5 ft cable.  USB C slots are not like the regular USB slot on a wall charger we are all accustomed to using.I am gonna love these the next time I fly!!",4.0 out of 5 stars

I work in a medical office around a lot of heavy loud machines and I love that I can cancel the noise around me.

CurlyEccentric,"I ordered these same day to where I was at because I left my AirPods at home. Overall the headphones are decent but would be my second choice after my AirPods. My real pet peeve was that the headphones would not stay in my ear. My ear canal is rather small, so I normally have to purchase extra small ear tips. These headphones came with small, medium and large but the small was too big for me and the headphones kept sliding out.The pro of these headphones was the noise cancellation and the bass sound of certain songs.Overall, these headphones were decent, but for the price point, I would lean towards the AirPods 3rd Gen or just pay a little more for the Pros, or Beats Fit Pros.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Cam,"These are my favorite ear buds. I had the apple ones for a couple of years and they never worked as well as these. I'm on my 3rd pair because I got one stolen and lost the other. Even buying three pairs though, its not as much as the apple ones. The battery lasts forever and the noise cancellation and sound quality is really great!! I would defiantly recommend these. You can also pair them to your devises on find my iPhone which I really like. All the features you can do with it you can do better than you can with the apple ones like pausing and answering a phone call and switching to noise cancellation. I 10/10 recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Just Joe,"I'm not an earbud snob.  I have generally thought people who spend over $100 on earbuds and airpods are status symbol idiots (and honestly, I still do).  I have a lineup of four sets of earbuds (JBL, JLab, Soundcore x 2), and none of them have exceeded $50, and I've been generally pretty happy with all of them.I only got these because I found a pair from Amazon Warehouse for $65 and I liked how blue they were.Comparing them side by side every other set of earbuds I currently own...it's no contest:  these are the best by an extremely wide and frustratingly noticeable margin.  Now I don't really want to use any of the other ones anymore.I'm not going to write about bass or equalizers or noise cancellation, because I really have no deep appreciation for these things.  All I can say is out of the box and shoved into my earholes, the sound is so crisp and clear...it's like magic.  Worth 2-4x the cost of the others?  Eh...maybe not, but Amazon Warehouse for the win, definitely worth at least $20-30 more than other options.Also noteworthy:  the case has a nice slim profile that is unintrusive in my pocket.Only complaint:  as others have noted, these stick out of your ears quite a bit if you wear them as intended.  No idea if this is a design flaw or necessary evil for all the tech under the hood, or just so you can flaunt the ""b"" logo at everyone who walks by.  I have found you can turn the logo facing up towards the sky which enables you to effectively tuck them in without any loss in sound quality (but then no ""b"" logo to show off).",5.0 out of 5 stars

TheReviewGuy,"I love these Beats Studio Buds.  My AirPod Pros were getting old and starting to make a crackling sound, but I wanted to see what else was out there before buying another pair.  I’m glad I found these.  They offer much more bass than the AirPod Pros do.  My favorite thing about these is the button.  It’s so much easier to skip tracks with a tap of a button as opposed to squeezing the stem of the AirPods.  Also, being able to control the volume with a touch is amazing.  I honestly can’t believe how much more I like these compared to the AirPods.The only downside is that the case feels flimsy.  I put it in a silicone case, which puts my mind at ease.Overall, I definitely recommend these!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars

I popped them in and continued to study for my assignments!It's also great if you want to listen to music in a loud environment. Just put them in, connect to your phone, and turn on some nice alternative music. It has a crispy clean sound and you won't hear a thing other than your music.They also fit really nicely in my ears, they come with different sized silicone earbud covers. They also don't slip off when I'm working out at the gym.The only bad thing I have to say is that the battery life wasn't as good as descripted. The first use lasted me about an hour and then I plugged them in overnight. When I went to use them at work, they died mid-shift (about 4 hours).

Christy,"I started off giving these earbuds 4 stars, and then realized that I was unfairly comparing them to Air Pod Pro's that are over $100 more expensive. For the relative value, these earbuds fit the bill.Feel: These earbuds are a bit slippery, and with the squat design it makes them a bit hard to grab. However, they fit snug into my ear so I don't have to over handle them much anyway. It takes getting used to putting them back into the case correctly.Looks: I like the variable colors. I bought these because I misplaced my tiny white Air Pods Pro case (whose last location deleted after 24 hours because Apple is a money monger). This red case is bigger but not cumbersome.Interaction: I don't like the button on the outsides of the buds. I wish the button was on the bottom with more of a squeeze function. To click the button, I have to essentially jam the bud further into my ear to get it to press. I also like to lay down with my buds in, but if I turn my ears against the pillow, the button is constantly pressing. A button positioned on the button (or top) would be way easier to pinch when on purpose without accidental clicks. At least clicking it doesn't pull the buds out of my ear; an issue I had with the lever arm of the APPs.Sound quality and connection: Good enough for me. Calls connected and sounded just fine. I don't need my phone calls to have live orchestra quality. The music seems good too. Not overly bass forward but crisp.ANC/Occlusion: The occlusion effect seems slightly worse than the Air Pod Pro's but no where near as bad as the Jabra's and other brands. I can sometimes hear my stomping on pavement but I don't hear my blood flow or anything. The ANC/transparency is also relatively equitable to the APPs, of course slightly not as significant in quality because these buds are much cheaper. It does seem to smartly block out certain sounds; i.e. my HVAC, while letting through someone calling my name.Haven't really tested the battery life but supposedly they're better than APP. Again, these are solid buds for the price. You get what you pay for, and these buds seems to prioritize what I actually care about so you don't have to pay $250 every time your APPs or Bose go missing.",5.0 out of 5 stars
