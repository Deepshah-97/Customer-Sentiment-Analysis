Mina,"Absolute terrible product from Apple. From the first day, there was issues with the headphones, after a while I took it to the apple store and they said there was a quality control issue and they changed it for free. I presumed since they knew about the issue, this one would be fine. So I just tolerated the terrible quality and headaches. Now I just took it to the store again and they said that again there was a problem with the product from the factory, but this time they asked for 190 dollars to replace it with the working product. Issues with the product from factory could happen occasionally. You do a recall and fix it. But the fact that they replaced the faulty product with another faulty product, probably knowingly, is absolutely frustrating. Apple is getting too good at ripping people off.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Meghan,"I used to love these but one of my AirPods recently developed an awful/loud buzzing. I contacted support and tried several things. Apple knows their AirPods Pro‚Äôs can develop a buzzing sound in noise cancellation or transparency mode. They even had a program to fix this issue outside of warranty, which they did for my husband. I bought my AirPods within one week of him, but my buzzing issue started a few months later. Now the program is defunct and Apple has the audacity to charge $250 to repair their faulty earbuds, which originally cost me $250 to purchase (and now can be purchased for $190)! I‚Äôm literally disgusted with that last bit. It‚Äôs shameful. I would recommend investing in something with more longevity.",1.0 out of 5 stars
stevethrewup,"These sound great.  They work like garbage.  Almost every day I open the case, put them on, and then find out that one or both of the airpods didn't charge.  I've tried various ways to reset and re-pair them with my phone but the issue remains.  The only real fix is the clean ALL of the contacts with alcohol almost every other day.  I spent at least a few hours on the phone with Apple Care gathering logs for them and troubleshooting; even being asked what I listen to when I wear them.  Ultimately, Apple wouldn't assist in any acceptable matter with this problem and wasted my money and my time.  I don't recommend at all.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Emanuel G√≥mez,"Make sure to purchase the Apple care protection plan, otherwise you will have to pay the consequences.At beginning, the product is amazing and everything works just as described. After nearly 2 years of usage, they will randomly disconnect from Bluetooth, the microphone is the worst; you can‚Äôt even record audios correctly, battery won‚Äôt last long. Most importantly, these are all well known defects this product has, which is why Apple always suggests to purchase the Apple care plan.Don‚Äôt buy unless you want to purchase AirPods every year and a half!",1.0 out of 5 stars
Tip your groomer,This is my second pair and whenever I use them the next day my ears have a clear liquid coming out of them! Didn‚Äôt happen with my last pair.

joe1023,Worked good for a year now the right side doesn‚Äôt put out sound. Called customer service tried everything they asked now if I want to give them $90 I could have the right one replaced.

This is the third pair of headphones I‚Äôve ordered on Amazon that I‚Äôve had a huge problem with. Either they don‚Äôt work at all, have major sound quality and buzzing problems, or the shipment just can't be guaranteed.

Jesus F Galaz,"I have to preface this by saying I'm an Apple fan. Have been since about '91. Love their products and service and use them for day to day work. I've own a pair of 1st gen AirPods for the last few years and they've started losing their recharge capacity. I decoded to get a nice AirPods Pro 2nd gen to treat myself. The product itself was nicely packaged, had extra ear insert fittings and a USB-c cable.I wore them in trying our sound quality for a movie and the Spatial reproduction was astounding. You'd move your head and the direction of the sound kept with the source (TV).But when I work them for a Zoom meeting using the noise cancelling, I noticed something that I didn't think would bother me. I couldn't hear my own voice when talking. It wasn't completely drowned out but very muffled. Didn't like that at all since it threw my off my game.The second issue that arose was after about an hour of wearing them I could feel them pressing against the inside chamber of my ear in a way that was painful. I compared the size of the Airpod Pros tot holder model and they are so much bigger. Just want to make sure everyone is aware of this size difference and if  you have a smaller size ear chamber to borrow a friends before purchasing. I ended up returning and buying the regular AirPods 2nd gen.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Brennan,Hands down worst earbuds for working out. I‚Äôve had many pairs of the different generation AirPods over the years because they‚Äôre the cool thing to get but I‚Äôm finally done with them. They fall out of your ears easy but that‚Äôs not even the worst part. God forbid you sweat in them a little bit because they‚Äôll stop charging in their case. I even have the case for the case and the cleaning kit but it doesn‚Äôt matter. You‚Äôll find yourself taking them out and putting them in over and over again trying to get the earbuds to connect to their case and start charging. Also you‚Äôll forget about this major flaw and get to the gym just to open the case and have dead earbuds. Haven‚Äôt even had this set long and they‚Äôre already messed up. I don‚Äôt know if this is an issue without the sweat so if you don't intend to workout with them then they might be fine. But if you do then get a different brand.,2.0 out of 5 stars
Phillip,"Inexplicably disconnects for no reason. At least once a day. Sometimes once per hour. I‚Äôve had it disconnect on me twice in the middle of a phone call! There‚Äôs no disputing the audio quality is great, I can give it a star for that, but if it can‚Äôt remain connected to the iPhone in my pocket with 99.9999999% uptime, it‚Äôs a crappy product.The weird thing is, my iPhone still shows it‚Äôs a connected device. I just can‚Äôt get my iPhone to play audio through it unless I turn off then turn on the Bluetooth, or until I plop the AirPods back in their case and then reinsert them into my ears. Not ideal when you‚Äôre exercising or trying to get chores done.Pretty surprisingly bad for an Apple product in an Apple ecosystem. I would recommend saving your money by buying any of the multitude of high quality Bluetooth headphones available.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Michael,"I've had more problems with the second generation in a couple months than I had with the first generation in two years. I use them for noise cancellation in a wood shop. Nothing crazy loud. They usually do fine, but if anyone uses an air nozzle to blow off their bench within 30 feet of me it blows up my ears with loud static. They've also had a har time with staying connected to my phone. Like if an alarm goes off on my phone while I'm listening to any audio it disconnects my headphones. This stuff didn't happen with my old headphones. Super annoying. I do however like being able to turn down the volume by lightly molesting my headphones, but again this is spotty and has created another issue where the headphones don't know if I'm trying to pause the music or just turn the volume down so it just does nothing.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Nicholas,"I got these to upgrade from my AirPod pro 1st gens. I have an iPhone 11 and these are not fully compatible. They do connect and I can talk, listen to music, etc. but I cannot have call waiting or hold conference calls with them. I had to stop using them and go back to my 1st gen ones until I upgrade my phone. I believe you need the 13 or newer to use them to their full capabilities.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Lance Blagg,Not sure what happened here...ordered these for my gf after I liked my pair so much. Somehow she got a different pair...different charger and noise cancellation barely works. We live in different states so I thought she was being dramatic when she said her noise cancelling wasn't much better than her old headphones...but then I tried them on this week when we visited and they just don't work. Now it's too late to return them unfortunately.,2.0 out of 5 stars
Caleb Warren,"At first, I loved these. The noise cancellation is crazy for earbuds, so good. But I bought these to replace a pair of 1st gen Apple AirPods that I used to run in. And while the sound quality is better, it doesn‚Äôt matter because these will not stay in my ears. The second I start sweating, they are about to pop out, and so my phone thinks I‚Äôm taking them out so the music pauses. It‚Äôs so frustrating, do NOT buy these if you have any intention of working out in them.",2.0 out of 5 stars
DL Pottery,The battery is constantly low or out of battery. Called Apple Supoort. She was very good about talking me through to reset it. But I had to reset it each day. This is my second set of AirPods so it‚Äôs not from not knowing how to use or reset it. She said it‚Äôs a software glitch but I think it‚Äôs a hardware issue.,2.0 out of 5 stars
We the people,Bought two of these thinking one was defective. Must just be a software issue that makes listening to music downloaded to Apple Watch unusable. Almost like it‚Äôs a connection issue but it‚Äôs not because my 12$ amazon copy‚Äôs work great and have better bass. The AirPods seem to work fine connected to the iPhone though. Apple support had no clue what was going on and kept asking basic troubleshooting questions but never touched on the actual issue.,2.0 out of 5 stars

Bill Hunt,The sounds is good. The noise cancellation is good but they just don‚Äôt fit as well as the old straight stem. I may have not paid extra if I had realized that.

Matthew D. Milburn,"Sound quality is good, not fantastic. There are better, cheaper earbuds out there. I purchased Apple Care + for my AirPods Pro 2 which specifically provides for Express Replacement Service of defective Air Pods so I would never be without my Air Pods 2 which I use for work calls  everyday. I spent 2.5 hours on web chat and the phone with Apple and my replacement was approved. I then received a call from a ""senior advisor"" that this option is no longer availible as of TODAY and that I would have to send in my AirPods Pro 2 for repair. When I look at my terms of warranty online AND enter my serial number it still says this express replacement service is available. After waiting on a significant hold time and then escalating it to a ""team level"" I was told they still offer this replacement service just not today, sorry. I asked for my Apple Care + to be refunded and was denied. I pay a significant premium over comparable brands to buy Apple products AND pay for their Apple Care service for peace of mind that I will not be without my devices. I highly recommend buying cheaper buds from another company that honors their expensive extended warranty. If you do buy AirPods, don't waste your money on Apple Care +.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Ruth M.,I was 14 months into my ownership with my Apple AirPods Pro and I noticed the right ear bud getting hot when charged then during the next use it did not work.  I went online to Apple support and after a very frustrating chat bot repeatedly kicked me to a self diagnosis then I finally got a human who basically said oh well there is nothing they will do.  NOT a great experience at all....  So at least you can count on them for a year then watch out,2.0 out of 5 stars
K.O.,"Bought a pair.  Loved them.  9 months in, the noise cancellation died.  Sadly, it didn‚Äôt just die though.  Instead it began making scratchy noises and getting in the way of listening.Apple replaced the item under warranty.  The new pair lasted about 4 months when they began exhibiting the same symptoms.Unfortunately, they were now out of warranty.  Apple said they would replace broken buds for $69ea.  Might as well buy new ones.A warranty is a great thing, but wouldn‚Äôt a better product that lasted be a better goal?

Veronica G.,"You would think apple would design a better product but idk‚Ä¶ the sound quality is very acceptable for me. They improved a bit, and all the processing it does with anc and transparency is quite impressive‚Ä¶ so convient with iPhone and Mac. The anc is jaw dropping.. WHEN YOU ACTUALLY SHOVE THEM IN YOUR EARS AND GET A PROPER SEAL!The design is seriously atrocious, they look great but gravity wants these earbuds badly‚Ä¶ 90% of the time they are actually on the floor!I do have odd shaping in my ears so I usually need foam tips or something around that line. Welp those don‚Äôt work either‚Ä¶. I ordered the foam masters for the gen 2s and they are actually worse than the stock ones. Can only get about 1-3 min of seal with the eartips supplied with the earbuds before they fall out. No bueno. At all. Makes me want to return them but everything else is so convenient about them. Hopefully the little bumpers I ordered will help keep them in my ears! Otherwise they r being returned. Maybe I‚Äôll consider if they redesign them completely. Also the sound quality is very acceptable for me‚Ä¶ but anything past 70% vol sounds atrocious, I guess that‚Äôs understandable.Lover volumes using Apple Music they sounds great and the spatial sounds very open and expansive, indeed like the sounds is coming from the phone with ‚ÄúiPhone tracked‚Äù (low to mid vol)  and fixed mode makes them sound like headphones. Very far and expansive I‚Äôm forgetting the term rn lol.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Bobbie,"I have owned a pair of basic AirPods lightning charging for several years, and they are starting to lose battery life. I never liked wired Apple headphones. They hurt my ears and would not stay in. The AirPods were basically flawless. I just wanted more on-bud controls and noise cancelling. Enter AirPods Pro. I was super excited to treat myself to upgraded headphones. I love my Bose QC45 over the ear for sound quality and noise cancelling, but as a glasses wearer, they hurt my ears and head so bad after a short time. After having the AirPods Pro for a few weeks, I can't help but feel a little sad that they will not stay in my ears. I am using the biggest silicone tips. They gradually work themselves out of my ear and fall off my head. This is just sitting at my desk. If I have a snack or eat lunch, they come out quicker. One thing that has helped somewhat is cleaning them and my ear canal with an alcohol wipe every day before use. I think everything is great about the AirPods Pro except for the fit. I didn't know there were other tips, so I guess I will search for foam to see if those will stay in my ears. So far, meeting attendees have told me my audio is perfect.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Jordan,"I really loved these earbuds. The hard plastic on the eartips that snaps onto the earbud is so ingenious. Personally, I don't like eartips because I need to hear my surroundings, but these eartips are so comfortable. You can wear them without the eartips, and they are just as great. One thing, though, is why did they choose the most slippery material, lmao?Now, the reason I returned these earbuds is because they are not Windows PC-friendly. I've tried everything from updating and changing drivers to almost every troubleshooting and CMD option out there. I even let a support agent take control of my PC to try to fix the problem, but nothing fixed the terrible audio glitching. It's so bad that the earbuds are unusable on Windows PCs.So, I really think Apple made the AirPods Pro 2 perform terribly on non-Apple devices on purpose. That is such a scummy tactic, and I hope the EU spanks Apple for it like they did for the charging port. Greedy company, but great hardware. Not a fan of the software, though.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Jean-Remy L.,"Having used lots of ANC headphones previously (OnePlus Buds Pro, Nothing Ear(1), Bose QC 35ii, Bose 7OO) I can tell you the pros and cons I see.Pros:- extremely lightweight and comfortable- great deal- audio on calls is excellent as is for musicCons:- strength of ANC is jarring- Adaptive Audio is quite poor, it sounds very similar to Transparency Mode. Would be better if it actually adapted to the amount of ambient noise- Ability to control how much ANC you want would be great- I‚Äôm use a variety of Apple products and didn‚Äôt find it to be a huge wow factor ‚Äî my other earbuds work just as wellOverall, expected much more from these earphones. Would be more likely to recommend the OnePlus Buds Pro if you‚Äôre looking for ANC, app to control EQ & ANC strength, dual connection.",3.0 out of 5 stars
adam hurd,"Sound: 5/10. There is no comparison to a good iem in the same price bracket. It's okay, right in the middle of the pack for sound quality. Its vocal frequencies are better than its bass/treble.Utility: 10/10. Absolutely amazing active noise cancelling, pass through, and quality of life features.Fit: 7/10. They're light and comfortable, but fall out over time. I tried all the tips and some aftermarket ones. The stock tips are best. You'll need to adjust them every 30min to keep a good fit.For music, I'd never choose these.But I wear these more often than any other iem.

imacuti,"Make sure that your AirPods are operating correctly before your 14 days are up with Amazon returns.

RBK,It‚Äôs for sure one of the top NC earbuds in market mainly for people in Apple ecosystem. There is lot of scope to make these earbuds reach out to different sizes of ears mainly small size. Just providing different sizes of ear tips would not help much mainly for small size ear like me. The plastic piece of the earbuds size makes my experience worse. All the surrounding of my ears feels tender pain by just wearing these earbuds for 15 mins. Even sound quality is not that great for this premium price point. Not sure if Apple even checks my review but I‚Äôm waiting for a redesign of these earbuds with little small earbuds size so that even small ear size people can have good experience. There are many reviews out there mentioned the same issue.,3.0 out of 5 stars
JMH921,"Bought these to replace my pair (same model) that I purchased a few months back and already lost. My original pair fit like a dream. These, not so much. The right side doesn‚Äôt have a snug fit, no matter which tip size I use. It just sticks out and eventually falls out.

¬†I love AirPods Pro and bought these specifically to eliminate the Lightning Port from my life. I gave my father the existing pair of second generation AirPods Pro that I had.

David,"These are 5 star as far as sound. Tight punchy transients, superb imaging placement exceeding my expectations for wireless devices. Though IDM music near highest volumes can produce distortion above 2khz with simultaneous sub content like 808 booms, overcoming that hurdle may require further engineering innovation for transducers this small. Most non-extreme typical content like voices and acoustic instruments is produced with striking detailed clarity. Some types of content such as compression envelopes that can easily distinguish real amps from sims or detailed textures of granular synths seem to benefit from the smaller transducer placed next to your brain‚Äôs audio-to-informational-magical converters.Regrettably I have to give only 4 stars and possibly three overall because you‚Äôll need to buy after-market accessories such as over the ear hooks or tighter fitting tips to secure these within your ear enough to use during active outdoor activities. (Perhaps my ears have atypical non-grabby canals ? Ie these ‚Äòextra comfortable not pokey‚Äô tips seem to merely float near my ear opening barely in it and move around vs staying snug within it regardless of tip size). Since I bought these to upgrade the cheap 30$ hook style ‚Äòoutdoor exercising‚Äô earphones I‚Äôve used for years, the superb sonic qualities I‚Äôm chuffed about kind of make the impractical looseness aspect all the worse.(Picture the Apple dongle bots weighing up offering the customer over-the-ear-hook accessories encased in sleek layers of white disposable packaging vs a new Apple AirPods Sport.)",4.0 out of 5 stars
Merlin Swartzentruber,"I am 57 and lost the hearing in my right ear 40 years ago. My left ear was great but it's beginning to show it's age. I purchased these with high hopes that the ""hearing aid"" function would help. I was not aware at the time that noise-canceling earbuds of any kind can, for some folks, lead to tinnitus or make current issues with that worse. After using these moderately over a weekend, I developed a severe case of tinnitus and there is no other known cause for it in my case; confirmed no ear infection, other illness, etc. I still gave these 4 stars as it is not the fault of the Air Pods themselves and they worked just fine. I will say that I was not as impressed with the ""hearing aid"" function as I thought I would be. Sound is amplified but sounds kind of tinny. I'm aware that hearing aids of any kinds take some getting used to so you'll have to try them for yourself if that's what you're looking for. I'm just sad that I ended up returning them as to continue using them poses too much risk to the hearing I do have left.",4.0 out of 5 stars

¬†I am a professional contractor who works onsite  or in my shop. I run power tools, all day (table saw, sliding compound miter saw, router, hammer drill, impact drills, nailer (pin, 18, 16, 15, framing, siding collated)All to be said, here‚Äôs my honest take.Over all these things are remarkable! Seamless connection with my iPhone, call quality is fantastic both ways. The sound precision for music is spot on. The adaptive, transparency and noise canceling are excellent features.  The fact it reads my texts to me and immediately gives me the opportunity to respond and send..this is fantastic because I usually have my hands busy with projects or am in a space that is not ideal for calls/texts (I.e crawlspace, attics).The noise cancelling is excellent, however, running loud power tools continuously, like table saw and routers is where I‚Äôve run into some issues. The ambient noise of the tool is tool much to handle, it is still loud. I‚Äôve found in that type of tool situation, I just some ear muffs to give me a bit more protection.Here‚Äôs the warning. Do not run tools on transparency mode, it magnifies the sound in the ear and it hurts. Adaptive is good if you are slowly easing into tool use. It does switch from transparency to noise canceling, but it not super fast.One other thing I‚Äôve found to be a nuisance is when low frequency sound modulates (like when car windows are cracked) makes the air pods make an uncomfortable sound in the ear.All in all, I highly recommend them!!Great job, AirPod team, this is a fantastic product!!PS",4.0 out of 5 stars

Steven,"The Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) have been a melodious addition to my tech ensemble. The enhanced active noise cancelling is truly impressive, providing an immersive audio experience that‚Äôs up to twice as effective as its predecessor. The adaptive transparency is a thoughtful feature, ensuring I‚Äôm still attuned to my surroundings when needed. Personalized spatial audio takes listening to a whole new dimension, while the MagSafe Charging Case (USB-C) ensures my earbuds are always ready to serenade my ears.However, while the audio quality and features are stellar, I did find that the fit can be a bit particular. It took some experimenting with the different ear tips to find a secure and comfortable fit. Additionally, while the MagSafe charging is convenient, it does require being mindful of ensuring the case is aligned correctly for optimal charging. But once these minor hurdles are navigated, the AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) deliver an unparalleled audio experience, whether I‚Äôm grooving to tunes or taking calls on my iPhone.And for a dad joke: Why did the music teacher go to jail?

4ubz,"I recently upgraded my iPhone XR to an iPhone 15 Pro, and have been invested in learning more about MagSafe charging. While exploring, I found out that the AirPods Pros offer wireless charging. Before purchasing these earbuds, I was using the original generation, first release Beats Studio Buds. One of the drawbacks of the Beats Studio Buds is that they only offer USB-C charging, not wireless charging through the case. Not only this, but I found that the buds hurt my ears after a while, not being able to wear them for long car rides or flights without my ears getting sore and fatigued. Another drawback to the Beats Studio Buds is that they didn't offer iCloud device switching, which was offered on the PowerBeats, and was a feature that I missed. With this, I decided to ditch the old Beats Studio Buds (although, I still keep them around for when I need earbuds that weren't such an expensive investment) and upgrade to the AirPods Pros 2.With Prime Day, I decided to get these AirPods Pros 2s on sale. I've been using them for around two or three days now, and have really enjoyed them, for the most part. In a positive aspect, I love the sound quality and the new H2 chip that Apple has implemented into the earbuds. I also love that the new USB-C case was available on Amazon on sale, so I can now officially use the USB-C charger for all my Apple devices and get rid of the lightning cable entirely. I'm now able to switch seamlessly between devices, going from my laptop to my phone almost immediately, which is amazing to have back. The case is lightweight and smaller than the Beats Studio Buds case, which I have enjoyed greatly. I also really love the fact that I can use Find My to find the individual earbuds and case itself for the AirPods Pro 2. The MagSafe/wireless charging for the buds is a gamechanger. The audio quality is really good, and they battery lasts a long time; even longer when recharging them with the case. There's also SO many different ways available of listening, noise cancelling, transparency, there's conversational awareness, adaptive audio, etc. It's quite impressive seeing how many features are offered and how much they contribute to the functionality of the buds themselves and user experience. I was worried about the AirPod Pros 2 not having a physical buttons like Beats usually do, how am I supposed to skip/rewind/pause/play without a physical button? I was sure that there were going to be missed inputs. I was wrong. The AirPod Pros 2 do a great job recognizing what I'm trying to accomplish, with only a few misreadings here and there (which, user error is also part of). Not only this, but I was SHOCKED to find out that you can also raise and lower your volume using the earbuds themselves; something that Beats earbuds has never been able to do. They automatically pause due to ear detection when it notices the bud is taken out of the ear. The buds also offer spatial audio, which is really cool. The functionality and accessibility of all of these features is truly amazing. I'm extremely impressed with all of the functionality that they offer, and just how many features Apple was able to stuff into technology so small. I doubt I'll be switching to any other earbuds any time soon, if at all, just because of how easy they have made my life just within the past three days.Now for the negatives. First of all, the lid squeaks and clicks. I've looked on various sources, apparently this is normal, allowing for there to be leeway if the case is ever dropped to prevent breaking or the hinge coming off entirely. Still something that concerned me initially, but I've gotten used to at this point. Additionally, I am worried about the hinge breaking, but it seems that it takes a lot of force for it to break off. Lastly, I find that the AirPod Pro 2s can be uncomfortable at times. The whole reason I stuck with Beats for so long was the fact they provided cushioned earbud caps, unlike the regular Airpods 1st and 2nd generation. With the Pro 2s, I figured I'd give them a shot because they actually offer earbud tips unlike the regulars. I still find that they are uncomfortable at times, and need adjusting. I've found that unlike other earbuds, AirPod Pros don't need to be ""shoved"" deep into the ear, but rather, are more designed to sit towards the outside/entrance to the ear while still providing a tight seal. This is new for me, as I'm used to ""regular"" earbuds (both wired and wireles) where they're meant to be pushed deep into the ear for it to seal and provide a comfortable fit. I'm still getting used to this change, but it seems that the more I leave them towards the entrance of the ear canal instead of pushing them as far in as possible, the more comfortable they are. You also have to make sure that the earbuds are angled correctly, where I found that the toothbrush (still not a fan of the look, but a little cost for all of the benefits they offer) part of the earbud needs to be angled a little forward for it to be appropriately set in the ear.Overall, I really like the earbuds and don't regret buying them. They provide a lot of awesome features, and great quality sound. They are integrated to all of my Apple devices, which is really nice, given that I own every form of Apple device and can easily transfer from one device to another. They're the first pair of reputable wireless earbuds that I've seen offer volume control on the actual earbuds themselves. The noise cancelling is amazing, as well as the adaptive audio and transparency mode.  The conversational awareness is a gamechanger, even though I tend to take an earbud out anyways, where it automatically pauses my music because of ear detection. I'm really happy with the buds and will definitely stick with these opposed to the prior Beats that I had before. For the price, especially on sale, it's more than justifiable and worth it. It's also worth noting that I was able to purchase AppleCare+ for the buds through Amazon, and didn't even have to register it, because the device automatically was delivered with AppleCare. That was really cool and really nice, as I was worried about buying them off Amazon and not directly from Apple Online or a physical Apple Store. I really enjoy the AirPod Pros 2, they're my regular earbuds now and I'm very satisfied with my purchase(:",4.0 out of 5 stars

I personally bought an iPhone 15 Pro this year and I HATED that my old AirPods were the only device that I had that used lightning instead of USB C. So I was able to finally get rid of that lightning charger with these new AirPods.The new AirPods pro also have MUCH BETTER battery life, sound quality, and noise cancellation from the old ones. I don't have to charge them nearly as much and they sound even better than they used to!They're great for listening to music and taking phone calls (though I sometimes have some friends and family complaining about my call audio when using AirPods.) Being able to have a convenient hands free experience is really important to me.In the box, you have multiple tip sizes for the AirPods, so if they don't fit well, make sure you try the other tips before returning. I also like that they added a spot to attach a lanyard. I personally am fine with putting them in my pocket, but I know a lot of people could benefit from that.Here are some cons/things to think about when buying AirPods:-Buy the AppleCare+ - so worth it. I put mine through the washer once and they replaced the whole set for $30. I also had a battery issue with my old ones once and it was free to replace the case. Basically if you damage them, you pay $30 and if there's no damage, there's no deductible. The Apple Store employee told me that I would have had to pay $90 for ONE PIECE if I didn't have AppleCare so totally worth it!-If you hate seeing scratches on the white case (not covered by AppleCare) then I would really recommend getting some kind of case. Probably won't do much to protect them, but at least it will keep them looking brand new.-If you have an older phone that uses lightning, you might want to think about finding one of the older kinds that has the lightning case. I HATED having to use multiple chargers so if you're like me, then you might want to try to buy those instead... But just know that all tech companies are moving to USB C for everything because of an EU mandate.",5.0 out of 5 stars
HJeffK,"I am a rare duck in the tech space as I really don't have a preference between Android and iOS. I have traditionally carried an Android phone and used Apple tablets and laptops. I just honestly find Samsung's innovation in hardware more intriguing. That said, I recently bought a new iPhone 15 Pro for a second phone to leave in my house and saw these new Airpods on sale, so I scooped them. The move to USBC convinced me I need to try both. I have used darn near every credible earbud that has come to market in the last four years. Sony, Bose, B&W, Anker, Apple, Beats, Sennheiser, and many others. I have been chasing the perfect set. I think I found them here or, at the very least, found the closest thing there is to perfection. Here are my thoughts on the new Airpods Pro2:Sound: This is the one area that they don't win hands down, but they sound great. Many of my buds feature larger more well tuned drivers. Some even have dual drivers. Many have the option to upscale to more lossless sound by using AptX. None of that is here, but what Apple has done with sound is commendable. There is good separation between the highs, mids, and lows. Unlike previous Airpods, these things bring a very solid low end that can rumble a bit. I am not an audiophile, but these sound really good. I still think that the new Sony buds and Sennheiser buds are better but it isn't a landslide. Apple has nailed it with active noise cancelling here as well. While the Bose Quiet Comfort buds are still the GOAT for me, these are at least as good as the runner up from Sony. These block out all but the most sudden noises. Really good all around.Call quality: These are easily the best there is for calls. It really isn't close. They do an unbelievable job of masking background noise so folks on the other end can hear you. I was on a call with a friend who was using them as well and his son was in the background gaming. He was yelling at the game and, occasionally when he spoke, I could pick up on it a bit, but only when he spoke. The processing here is just so good.Form Factor: I hate stem style buds generally, but these are solid. They are light and have real balance in the ear. I think because the Pro's have silicone tips they just work better for me. The squeeze functionality makes these so accurate to use when compared to others that rely on tapping and the swipe volume control is really outstanding. For my ears, and this is subjective for sure, these are all day comfortable. You get a solid IP54 water and dust resistance, so these will hold up well in the gym.Battery Life: These are average in this space when compared with their peers. I am getting about five hours on bud. You get another three to four charges from the case. Many others are better here, but I find battery life to be perfectly acceptable for everyday use.Intangibles: There are almost too many things to mention here. First, the case is, as always, the best in the business. It is tiny, solid, packs a great battery, and has the most satisfying magnetic click when closing. I love the spatial audio. It is gimmicky but really fun when it is executed properly during a show or movie. The speech detection is amazing. As is the easy pairing and use on the iPhone. Find my buds is the BOMB. There is so much more that I will update later. These are very well thought out.Conclusion: For me, Apple has crushed it here. Having FINALLY moved to USBC (even if it took the EU to force them) makes all Apple things so much better. These buds might not be the best at much, but they are very good at everything. I can honestly say that these are the best buds on the market. Will I use others for different occasions? Yes, but I doubt that as long as I have an iPhone, I will use many of them often. Buy these now with complete and total confidence. Wow Apple, just wow! Well done!***Update*** So, I am three weeks in with these and I have a couple of other thoughts I should add. First, the thing that jumps off the page to me is the speaker built into the case. I have owned dozens of buds and this is a first to me. It is awesome. The case chimes when the buds are properly returned to the case. You get a low battery notification and it is also used to ‚Äúfind my AirPods.‚Äù It is simply brilliant and an example of how thoughtful some of Apple‚Äôs designs are. The case is simply next level and that means more than most people think since you interact with it regularly. The other thing that stands out is how much customization there is and how intuitive it is to set up in your settings. Sony offers similar customization and, in some ways more, but it takes a lot more work. Like I said, there are better options for a lot of things, but the polish and attention to detail here from Apple make these a clear winner overall. If you are on the fence, don‚Äôt be. I will update with anything else but these are easily the best all around buds on the market. Buy with confidence",5.0 out of 5 stars
DKDC,"I grabbed the 2nd Gen AirPods Pro on sale a few weeks ago to upgrade my 1st Gen pair specifically for the increased noise cancelling performance enabled by the H2 chip. True to Apple's claims, ANC is more effective and connectivity/switching between my Apple devices is way more reliable than 1st Gen. Here's a quick rundown of the advantages:- Adaptive mode responds quickly to tune out noise and pass through things like speaking- Better noise cancelling and clearer Transparency mode- Faster/more reliable connecting/switchingSome nice to have things:- USB-C charging <3- MagSafe charging + works with Apple Watch charger- Speakers built into case for FindMy pingsFor most people, this isn't worth the upgrade if you already have 1st Gen (but I HIGHLY recommend upgrading from non-Pro models if you can afford it), but here is why I did it:I've been going to a lot of loud concerts for years, and that has caused some damage to my hearing because I foolishly did not wear proper ear protection for too long. I am now *highly* invested in protecting hearing from further damage, and I've spent plenty of time researching and testing some of the best specialty ear plugs on the market.When the 2nd Gen AirPods Pro came out, I immediately started researching whether ANC can actually protect your ears from exceptionally loud environments like concerts, given the incredible sampling rate enabled by the newer H2 chips. I found several reputable sources that confirmed they work for concerts specifically, so I immediately upgraded my 1st Gen set to test at a show in November.Let me tell you--wow. First of all, well-fitted AirPods Pro block out a ton of sound when they are off. With ANC, outside noise reduction is unbelievable. But the real magic happened when I turned on Adaptive mode. It was like turning the volume down on the entire show to a safe volume without sacrificing sound quality much at all. Only at the absolute loudest volumes‚Äîparticularly when the bass spiked‚Äîdid the AirPods noticeably clip from time to time as they tried to quickly adjust to extreme changes in noise levels, but never problematically so.",5.0 out of 5 stars
PedalingAstronomer,"I‚Äôm too old to be one of those guys who wears AirPods everywhere.I listened to music while I work, and I worked mostly from home, so I was never tempted to be that guy and considered the habit a presumptuous affectation when I‚Äôve encountered others who wore them in public.And I‚Äôve had other competent noise-cancelling buds and was never tempted to wear those when out. Sure, they made hearing phone conversations easier in noisy environments, but I rarely talked on my phone when in public spaces, because, yeah, that felt presumptuous too.Then I switched to an iPad Pro-Magic Keyboard combo from a Windows laptop as my primary work device, which convinced me to migrate from Android to an iPhone, so investing in AirPods just made sense, given Apple‚Äôs matchless ecosystem integration.Now, when a call comes in via my iPhone, while I‚Äôm working and listening to music on the iPad, I can answer the call from the iPad through the same AirPods with zero effort. I just tap and talk as if the iPhone were in my hand. And I can hear the caller even better with the AirPods than with other buds. Plus, the AirPods‚Äô ANC doesn‚Äôt cause the mild sense of pressure the others did.But that‚Äôs not all. The AirPods‚Äô transparency mode is so scary good, I can hear every external sound ‚Äî especially voices! ‚Äî better with than without them, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm now tempted to wear them in public and have had to revise my previously negative opinion of others who do.Oh, and the spatial audio feature? I expected that to be a gimmick, but it‚Äôs accurate yet subtle, and having tried it, I no longer use the AirPods without it.Bottom line: If you see me out and about with AirPods in my ears, I‚Äôm not trying to drown you out. I‚Äôm trying to hear you better amid whatever cacophony surrounds us. And as with the iPad, having experienced the AirPods Pro 2, there‚Äôs no going back.I‚Äôm not an audiophile, so I can‚Äôt rate that aspect of the AirPods. I can only report that the base, mids, and highs sound as crisp and clear as through anything else I‚Äôve used. I listen to recordings now that I first experienced in the ‚Äò50s and ‚Äò60s, and I hear elements I couldn‚Äôt know existed back in the days of AM radios with mono speakers. The AirPods have been a revelation in that sense, too.As for fit, I travel by bicycle and now wear the AirPods to better hear turn-by-turn directions (for safety, I keep them in transparency mode when on the bike), but however actively I‚Äôm pedaling, I haven‚Äôt felt at risk of the AirPods falling out of my ears. Plus, they‚Äôre comfortable enough that I can wear them the full ~six hours I pedal each day when traveling.What would I change? Well, they‚Äôre white, and in my perfect world, they‚Äôd be the color of darker skin, so the fact that I‚Äôm now a guy who wears AirPods in public wouldn‚Äôt be so obvious. Tan, brown, or black would be nice options. Otherwise, they‚Äôre kind of perfect.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Mitch,"I've used all sorts of TWE wireless buds over the years, but I having never owned and iPhone or anything within the Apple ecosystem until more recently, I never had a compelling reason to look into the AirPods. Having recently switched to the new iPhone 15 Pro Max and Watch Ultra 2 I thought I would take these for a spin on the $189 Black Friday deal. Oh my gosh am I glad I did! These have a very natural sound to them, and really are perfect all-around good ear buds. If I'm consuming media or listening to music these are very good - not perfect in this department, but they are VERY good and have a very balanced sound and great sound stage. These buds are literally second to none in terms of ANC and call/speech clarity. The ANC is the best I've heard in any earbuds - which is also better than the new Sony XM5's in my opinion. Call clarity and speech coming through these things is also second to no other buds I've heard. These are just so good! Then you throw in the added bonus of how seamlessly these integrate with my new phone and watch... I've been missing out not having had this trio until now. I've ascended to a new technological level. I would gladly pay full price for these - but if you can get them on a deal, don't hesitate, just do it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
PNani,"The Apple AirPods Pro provide several improvements over competing wireless earphones on the market as they go into their second iteration. The introduction of USB-C charging is a useful advancement that offers users additional rapid and adaptable charging choices. Because of USB-C, this update is possible. While still following conventional charging guidelines, the latest update simplifies the process of using the AirPods Pro.These headphones have amazing active noise cancellation (ANC), which is up to twice as effective as previous versions. Because it enables listeners to focus on the audio without being distracted by background noise or voices, this innovation is especially useful in busy areas. Because of its remarkable potency, the ANC technique offers clients a soundscape that is practically unparalleled.Another useful feature is the Transparency Mode, which allows the user to move between noise isolation and ordinary hearing with ease. This is an important development in the business when it comes to keeping an eye on your surroundings, whether you're conversing with someone or strolling through a busy location.Apple's Adaptive Audio, which enhances the listening experience using artificial intelligence, is a fantastic illustration of innovation. Regardless of your location, the earbuds' excellent audio quality is ensured by their ability to detect and adjust to their environment. A listener's listening experience can be greatly enhanced by having this kind of customizing choices.Tailored spatial audio raises the level of immersion to completely new heights and allows for a more personalized experience. This technology tracks the user's head movement dynamically and creates an immersive, multidirectional, spatialized audio experience. This amazing feature comes in very handy for individuals who want their audio to sound more like it was made for those platforms‚Äîgamers and movies.The comfortable and secure fit of the stylish yet functional AirPods Pro is guaranteed by their high-quality construction, which is still produced to an exceptionally high standard. The touch-sensitive interface offers straightforward and easy control over services like calls, music, and other items. The earbuds fit well and are a great choice for people who lead active lifestyles because they stay in place regardless of what the wearer does.The best connectivity of any headphones available on the market is found in Apple's AirPods Pro (2nd Generation), thanks to their stable and intuitive Bluetooth connection. Positive impressions are enhanced by the simple method of connecting with an iOS iPhone or any other device that is compatible.These high-end wireless earbuds are justified in price for those who anticipate it due to their improved audio quality, more functionality, and easy interaction with the Apple ecosystem.With their remarkable performance, sophisticated appearance, and state-of-the-art features, the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) have finally raised the bar for wireless headphones. Because the earbuds are wireless, this achievement was made feasible. These earbuds are a great choice for anyone who loves music and travels regularly, as well as anyone who is interested in technology, because they provide an amazing and immersive audio experience while adhering to the Apple idea.",5.0 out of 5 stars
SupaQuax,"I never really had much luck with earbuds, so I was a little skeptical about spending over $200 on a pair, but I saw some reviews and videos which did raise my expectations a little bit but not much. These earbuds are probably the best earbuds I've ever bought. The noise cancellation in them is very interesting because I never used a pair of earbuds that has this feature so I dont (and still dont lol) know how it works but its just amazing! It drowns out all if not all noise except for isolating peoples voices so you can hear them with the earbuds in while not playing any kind of audio. I love how the cups snap into place so you never have to worry about them falling off. I was able to wear these for very long periods of time (usually while working) and my ears havent felt uncomfortable once. The audio is very crisp, and the position they sit at feels like they're loose but they're not! Just like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac systems, the earbuds are aesthetically pleasing whether you're using them or not. Best purchase I made, next to my iPhone 15 Pro.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Blair,"I took advantage of a big sale and I do not regret it! They are way better than my old AirPods. The noise cancellation, the additional control features, the additional sound features and quality, all of it is amazing!I have a pair of over the ear noise canceling headphones (not Apple) that I like, but they aren‚Äôt the level of quality you‚Äôd get from Apple, Bose, etc. I still love them though. But these have really good sound quality that outshines them, but the noise cancellation is about equal (the AirPods may be just a little better). Plus, these stay in my ears more easily than my old AirPods and I don‚Äôt have to bring my over the ear headphones with me every time I got to work at a coffee shop or something.

I don't use the spatial audio much but feature is pretty cool.I have had an earbud fall out of my ear when bending over a couple times but I'm sure that depends on each persons ear shape and if it isn't seated properly.

sandy,"There‚Äôs not much to say here. It‚Äôs your regular Apple product. They are the latest generation when it comes to the AirPods. I notice that the spatial audio is better quality, I also like that I don‚Äôt have to locate my phone to increase the volume. The whole reason I purchased these was to have access to my phone without having to carry my phone. I can be anywhere in my 1,800sq ft, one story home and still use them. I notice there‚Äôs a breakup if I‚Äôm leaving the house without my phone if I‚Äôm on it, but not when I‚Äôm listening to music. I‚Äôve only been able to use one side of the headphones because I got a new piercing so my other ear is still sore. The one AirPod I‚Äôm using has done the work.Also, I like that I can mute the call by ‚Äúpressing‚Äù the stem once, instead of ending the call. You press it twice to end a call. If you get another call and you press once to click over for another incoming call, it will hang up your current one. To access noise cancellation at any time, you just hold the stem until you hear it ‚Äúopen‚Äù or ‚Äúclose.‚ÄùOverall, I can tell the difference and the battery life is way longer than my old AirPod Pros 2nd gen. There‚Äôs also an even smaller AirPod suction thingy piece that you can change if your ear is smaller than the small  lol",5.0 out of 5 stars
Todd R. Beaman,"I tried multiple pairs of earbuds trying to spend less and get everything I wanted.  The AirPod Pro 2 checked every box and eventually blew me away.I tried the Sony Link Bud S, Sony 1000XM5, Beats Studio Buds, SoundPeats Air4 Pro and the SoundPeats Life.I was down to my final pair to try, the EarFun Free Pro 3.  They sounded amazing and I was ready to return my Airpods Pro 2's.  That was until I connected my AP2 to my Apple TV 4k.  The sound these produce on some programming blew my mind.  It's like I had my home theater going but without any background noise (kids, wife etc...) .  I was sold and I'm keeping them.The noise canceling is next level.  The sound is excellent.

Kristi Groff,"I recently purchased the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) during prime day and boy have I been impressed.  I have been a long time Jlab earbud user but have always been disappointed by the fit.  I have very petite ears and have always struggled to find a well fitting and comfortable pair of earbuds.  Most earbuds I have tried are simply too large and do not fit securely and will dislodge themselves during any physical activity.I was surprised by how comfortable the AirPods are even after several hours of use. They fit securely without the fear of falling out but not too snug that they become uncomfortable after an extended period of time.  With multiple different sizes of eartips, you‚Äôll be sure to find a comfortable fit.The sound quality is excellent, clear and crisp.  Perfect for enjoying my favorite audiobooks.My favorite feature so far, is the active noise cancellation transparency mode which allows you to hear outside noises without being intrusive.  As a woman, it is extremely important to always be aware of your surroundings especially when listening to earbuds while out in public.  This feature allows me to still be aware of my surroundings while enjoying my earbuds.Setup was quick and easy.  Within minutes, I was able to pair them to my iPhone and begin enjoying them.Overall, I would highly recommend the AirPods Pro not only for their functionality and performance, but also for their comfort and ease of use.",5.0 out of 5 stars

JLC,"I had the first gen of AirPods Pro & this 2nd gen has much improved in sound, charging cord & battery.  It was worth the upgrade.  Apple has finally done something right with the sound.  I could hear the bass & everything in between.  Now if only the battery lasted for 10 hours long, that should be their next step.  But yah, these are keepers because I got them on prime days & they are worth every penny.  They connect so easy to any apple products  from Mac, iPad, & iPhone.  Would recommend to any that have apple eco system!!I wanted to update on these now that I used it for close to two weeks & I swear the sound is getting better & better!!  The NC is incredible but with the spatial sound on made the bass little less bassy.  The transparency mode is top notch as if I didn't have these buds in, just incredible.  I bought a little protection case for these & it still charges through my Apple Watch puck & the holes for the lanyard is pretty handy.  I feel like whenever I put these in they're not going to stay in but I worked out with these.  I did cardios & weight lifting, ran outside & they did stay in my ears.  Now that I updated my phone there's adaptive sound for these buds which controls the surrounding sound in where ever I'm at.  With all the features (which I haven't even listed all) this is a steal compare to other buds like Bose or Sony.  I sure got a steal on prime days & now that I know more about them I would've payed retail!!  I tried the locator to look for these gems & they work so well.  The locator is in each of the ear buds & also in the case!!

I find they are also great for meditation for the same two reasons.  The noise cancelation on an airplane was good but seems like it could be better.  I doubt any earbud would be better in that noisy environment.My only complaint is that they do not stay in my ear when I am doing easy, gently yoga.  They popped out even while I moved slowly.  This should have lowered my score to a 4, but the sound is so good, I will keep it at a 5.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Dr. Trent,"They‚Äôre AirPods, don‚Äôt expect perfect sound quality, but also you‚Äôll be surprised at the performance and sound quality they pack in to such a small device. Sound is very clear, and volume level is good, though I don‚Äôt blast music so I can‚Äôt say if they get as loud as some people like. The battery on these things are great, especially if you only listen to music with one in at a time, and swap to the other after the battery dies hours later. They also fit really well, and the included size eartips work well.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Glenn A. Carleton,"I had two older pro models, loved them, but read reviews on improvements and wanted to see if latest model worked at fitness club where music can be very loud and annoying. Major improvement in quality of sound, did not expect, and noise reduction so good now do not have to take Bose over the head phones to club (older model did not block loud noises enough).  Not quite as good as the Bose, but that is because those headphones cover the entire ear. Another reason I got is supposed ability to use to enhance conversations in a group, very surprised how much better it is over last model. Hard to imagine next upgrade will get this much better unless they offer colors",5.0 out of 5 stars
ljam,"I have an Android phone, and I have tried a bunch of noise canceling earbuds, from lower end ones with crappy noise canceling, up to the Pixel Buds 2 and Bose QuietComfort II, and I returned them all. I have small ears, and most wouldn't stay in my ears or they hurt, even with alternate eartips. The Bose fit great but wouldn't stay connected to my devices (a known issue). I also have an iPad, so I gave in and bought the AirPods. They fit perfectly, don't fall out of my ears, are comfortable for hours, paired and worked perfectly with my iPad, and the noise canceling is excellent. I love the conversation awareness setting that lowers the volume of your media and enhances voices in front of you if you speak. And in transparency mode, you don't have to take them out to hear other people clearly. They also work just fine with my Android phone.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Timothy Karibian,"I really enjoy how powerful these airpods feel in my ears. From how great the noise canceling is, to the great base, to even how they work smoothly with my apple ecosystem! I used to wear the beats pill looking pods and they were alright, expect they didn‚Äôt latch onto my ear properly. Plus, I still have to rely on grabbing my phone for volume controls which tends to be a handful as the old buds kept trying to flee from me while I clean the dishes or eat some late dinner. I haven‚Äôt experienced my pros slipping out as much fortunately, although I would still recommend getting yourself some accessories to help them to wrap around your ears securely. Overall, if you have some money to kill and have at least one apple product, I would say these airpods pros are a worth while upgrade to your listening needs!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Sarah Acosta,I used to have the 1st generation AirPods and I finally needed an upgrade. I decided to buy these AirPod Pros and they are genuinely the best headphones I‚Äôve ever had! These work amazing and the battery life is great! The volume is great and I don‚Äôt know that it came with different sized ear tips to fit the size of your ears. So that was great!!! I think this is the best purchase I‚Äôve made this year!!,5.0 out of 5 stars
Arron t.,One of the biggest things i like is the ability to turn down the volume right from the buds this feature alone was worth the purchase. The new adaptive audio is pretty awesome and does what they say it does. The conversation awareness is and ok feature and would probably suite someone in an office setting better than the setting that I work in but it does work. Really happy with the updates apple made on these and make them what I wanted the gen1 pros to be.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Arnisa Sylevic,"I have been wanting these for a while now, I‚Äôd been stuck with the first gen airpods since my freshman year of highschool (im a senior now lol) and I finally got a job and bought them! I was super excited when they came and they work beautifully. I haven‚Äôt charged them once since I got them, and it‚Äôs been about a day of using them full time all the time! They connected really easy. There is different sizing for the little rubber ear piece, in case your ear hole is a bigger or smaller size. I‚Äôm enjoying these thoroughly and I hope they last me a good while.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Mortimer Snerd,"We live in an open two story home.  My wife watches Netflix on a laptop downstairs, while I watch cable upstairs.  Despite sitting right in front of her laptop, she used to listen on the laptop speakers at a volume that disturbed my viewing upstairs, causing what others would call marital friction (we are used to it).  I tried giving her a high-quality headphone to use, but she didn't like it.  In desperation I shelled out the price for these air pods or whatever Apple calls them.  So far she is using them!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Also the improvements to the noise cancellation and transparency modes are great.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Carson Anderson,I had the original airpods and noticed recently that they weren't keeping a charge anymore and I knew it was time to upgrade. I must say these new airpods are so much nicer!

I'm an Apple girly and these don't disappoint.,5.0 out of 5 stars
HawkPilot,"I still think that these are the best on the market for iPhone users.  The great noise cancellation, the good bass response, and the seamless integration makes these the best.

Steve,"I bought these as an early Christmas gift for my wife. She was very impressed with the sound quality.

Gary O. Norris,"Absolutely a phenomenal audio experience. Incredible fidelity, absolutely simple installation to your Apple devices (unlock your phone or iPad, open the AirPods case and click on ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù).The volume control is difficult to operate on the AirPods to the point of being nonfunctional; but, you can ask Siri to change the volume or do it on your device.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Simply Stated,"I was impressed, as were others, with all of the amazing features.  The noise cancellation is top notch. The features are a real game changer.  That said, the audio at the default settings was nothing impressive, and the airpod 2 pro menu that pops up in settings when paired offered nothing helpful to adjust.  I did a bit of sleuthing and found in IOS where you can adjust the frequency response (not the presets in the music app), and what a difference it made.  It isn't a true equalizer, per se, but it gives you enough control and options to turn these from good to amazing audio.  So here is where you go: Settings...Accessibility...Audio/Visual...Headphone Accommodations.  Turn the latter to ""on"".  Then play around with settings for ""tune audio for:"" and adjust whichever of the three options you choose for ""slight, moderate, or strong"".  Get ready for a whole new level of audio.  In the pic, you can see my preferences.  By the way, and unlike the preset options in the music app, the settings here impact all of the audio through the airpods, not just apple music.  By the way, you actually can find these settings through the airpod menu, but they are buried so incredibly deep I provided what I thought was an easier route. For those that didn't know about this, I hope you enjoy this hidden control for the airpods as much as I do.  On another note, there is an ability to use Find My app to find the airpods, and that includes the case and left and right airpods, separately.  When you get close enough, it even shows a directional arrow and you can make all three chirp (play sound), individually, to help locate.  I'm not a fan of the volume controls on the earbuds.  I find they don't work well, but I use my iphone to control, anyhow.  All that said, I am very impressed with these once I found the ""equalizer"".  Audio quality matters to me most at the end of the day.  Happy listening!",5.0 out of 5 stars
spiletic,"These are the best made to date! They fit well, and the sound quality is very good compared to the older models. They were purchasing through Amazon versus Apple, saving $$.

Werdna,"Took me a while but my gen 1 AirPod Pros worked just fine though I wish the bass was better and I thought it would be a good time since they just released the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C.Very happy with the bass quality and the noise cancellation does seem to be better. Another selling point was the ability to control the volume from the stalk of the AirPods, as I would find myself trying to adjust the volume of whatever I was listening to away from the device.The additional features such as adaptive noise control, personalized volume, and conversational awareness is neat but not huge benefits for me.",5.0 out of 5 stars
J. Butler,"These are my second earpod pros.  The first ones quit after a year and Apple wanted $259 to repair.  A first for me as Apple has always stood behind their merch.  That said, I love the convenience, sound, and ease of use so I bought another pair.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Sebastian,"They have incredible build quality and aesthetic, but it‚Äôs Apple, so you already knew that. I can find similar earbuds with the same sound quality and noise cancellation for $120. What you‚Äôre paying for is the truly seamless connectivity, and a lot of useful features such as Spatial Audio and pretty good microphones. I will say that the 2nd generation AirPods have over 2 times better noise cancelling that I would say is unparalleled across earbuds. Otherwise they are nearly identical to the first generation.",5.0 out of 5 stars

S & N,"So far these are a night and day difference from the 1st gen AirPods I had which recently started having connectivity issues and one bud got quieter after I tried cleaning it. These new ones are insanely good at noise cancelling, almost too good if using them in public. The spatial audio sounds so good and I like the upgraded case. Only thing I‚Äôm not a fan of is the actual earbud part because it‚Äôs a tighter fit than the 1st gen ones were and I have a feeling these will get dirtier quicker. Overall satisfied with the purchase since I got these for $60 off on Prime Day. Fingers crossed they last me 5+ years like my 1st gen ones did.",5.0 out of 5 stars

avidreader,"I bought these Apple Airpods during the Amazon Prime Deals sale. I've been wanting to try them for a few years and the price helped me finally decide to give them a try. I mainly needed them for use with audiobooks. The noise cancellation is shockingly good. Even when standing fairly close, you can watch someone's lips move but not hear what they're saying. It works so well that several times I have been surprised by someone walking up behind me without even realizing it. After trying all the different tips, they do bother my ears a bit, but I'm only five feet tall, and my ears are small.

HBTourSlam,Apple has done it again. Supreme hardware with amazing software no other company comes close to making an experience like this with your iPhone. I dabbed a little bit with Sony WF-1000XM4 unfortunately the experience is not as smooth and magic the way Apple does it. Apple has a software experience that just makes sense to get them if you have an iPhone and if you are in the ecosystem. USB-C on AirPods Pro is just the cherry on top. Not only that but I got theses on sale for $199.99 so I pulled the trigger when I saw that. Hand downs this was a great purchase feels premium like everything Apple does. The software goes so well with the AirPods being able to see battery and AirPods charge on iPhone. It‚Äôs just a great experience for an already highly invested person like me that‚Äôs in Apple ecosystem already.,5.0 out of 5 stars

There are lots of setting options which are to many to point out here,  I recommend watching some YouTube videos explaining the options.

Ben W.,"There are better reviews of these headphones, which talk about all the unique features and technology packed into these little things. I will speak to a frugal person‚Äôs perspective on these premium earbuds. I have muddled with Anker Soundcores for the last year and have been utterly disappointed. I used a lightning adapter with IEMs to get great sound. However, both experiences were never compelling. Whether it be disconnects from Bluetooth, poor noise canceling, or, more likely, inferior transparency mode, all my other earphone purchases had their flaws.These earbuds are worth the money. Honestly, if you have an iPhone and are looking for headphones, do not think you will find a comparable experience or sound with any other earbuds. You won‚Äôt. The integration of these things is astounding and makes pairing the headphones and the iPhone seem like magic is happening behind the scenes. These things are killer from the transparency mode, bass response when listening to music, and seamless handoff between devices. These aren‚Äôt just a little bit better than the competition, they are a lot better.So, from a frugal perspective, save your dollars, make coffee at home, eat in, give up alcohol for the month, and enjoy the superlative experience of the AirPod Pros. Your ears will thank you.You probably don't need the cute case that makes your AirPods look like an avocado. Less critical of an upgrade, for sure.",5.0 out of 5 stars

In every case, the AirPods have provided superior noise cancellation performance. And I also like the sound quality, being something of an audiophile.

ATLGolfer (Jeremy),"I thought i had lost my 1st Gen airpod pros and couldn't find them with ""Find My"".  I ordered these when Amazon was running a deal and I'm glad I did.  I love the new conversational awareness and the noise cancelling is perfect.Of course, a week after these came in, I found my 1st Gen in my car.  Not sure why ""Find My"" wasn't tracking them as they still had plenty of battery and showed them at a location 20 miles away as last seen.",5.0 out of 5 stars
